finding acceptable the public something that should have been accepted some years ago theme long overdue for public acceptance but one that better received late than never there has some common sense distinguishing what drugs should legalized and how educate the public this rather than making police matter altogether the film opens quaint cornish seaside village the funeral the husband middle aged

1 |text when first heard that disney next animated feature was going tarzan was almost horrified was worried that disney was going make another hercules sorry jerk ules that effort was too overloaded with comedy and the hero was too boastful and pompous considered sympathetic hero and after viewing this day find disgrace for disney animation when saw the trailers was thinking hmm this isn bad all this just might have potential when bought the soundtrack was really quite surprised how different sounded from most disney features have never really heard phil collins nor have heard mark mancina was wondering how would these two make this disney flick spin was pleasantly surprised the music top notch phil collins songs are terrific percussion heavy pieces work that seem break the formula for typical disney songs the score from mark mancina was also neat reminded bit the lion king but was more original the soundtrack wasn bad all considering was two people not familiar with this film could good but will when finally went see opening day tend with most disney animated features question was answered complete turnabout expectations for disney tarzan surprisingly decent the story starts out with tarzan parents surviving shipwreck and finding home island where apes live peace however one day vicious leopard sabor attacks and kills tarzan parents leaving him this time baby alone until kala the apes rescues him kala wants raise the child her own she lost hers previously sabor but her mate kerchak not too sure not our kind says agrees though let her take care little tarzan but that doesn make him son tarzan grows vowing the best ape ever but matter how hard tries what does the guidance his hilarious ape friend terk just can convince kerchak that one the apes even when defeats sabor battle one day new animal shows humans this where jane comes into the picture she expedition with her father professor porter and despicable hunter clayton searching for gorillas tarzan rescues her when she chased baboons and soon they get know each other even though tarzan falls love with jane this causes things wrong clayton tricks tarzan into taking him jane and porter see the apes who are convinced that has betrayed them worse clayton has plotted send the gorillas london for money will tarzan find out which family belongs and save the apes not gonna tell you sorry you gonna have see for yourself and see you should the animation always top notch particularly when tarzan goes soaring through the trees read that skateboarding the deep canvas computer generated effect adds authentic feeling the jungle which tarzan lives fact seems similar the computer imagery cel animation combination rival disney animted films such fox anastasia and dreamworks prince egypt could that disney was actually taking ideas from their rivals the casting fairly good tony goldwyn emotionally believeable tarzan and relief the animators have succeeded not making him another hercules nicely done and glenn close wonderful kala she has beautiful singing voice too the way lance henrikson kerchak somewhat reminds robby benson beast voice which makes him all the more ferocious and gripping minnie driver had little worried first the voice jane thought she had the most annoying voice the whole film when first saw the trailers but when saw the film didn have problem with her take back insult driver nice hear nigel hawthorne another voice for disney animated feature was fflewdurr flamm disney most underrated classic the black cauldron funny and delightful professor porter the villiany side the voices brian blessed the guy who did boss nass star wars episode the phantom menace brings pompous and later vicious voice the sinister clayton might not the strongest character the film just plain bad guy nothing else but blessed vocal work contributes greatly but there any voice that think steals the whole show should rosie donnell who hilariously funny terk she also has fiesty attitude gonna kill she says more than once almost sung along with her during one the film best moments where the apes make mess the human camp via song scatting shoo doo dah can see why she wanted have rock song for the film she good singer not that she was the only funny character the film though wayne knight who played stan space jam gives whimsically funny style tantor elephant who especially worried about stepping into sanitary water thankfully there real sound flatuence that would have killed the picture the songs said before are decent mostly sung collins this sets new standard for disney animated films because for the first time the characters not sing tolerate musical numbers from characters lot more than some other guys would but found this nice change pace the story does have elements comedy but they also load with strong dramatic touches which makes this film far better than the unbelieveably uninspired hercules there anything disappointing about tarzan might the omission the sync version trashing the camp from the film heard the soundtrack and wondered where was going was upset that wasn because had thought taking few friends mine who like sync see tarzan well overall was enthralled with tarzan wouldn hold high the way with mulan the hunchback notre dame all time favorite disney classics but this film deserves high place among disney greatest achievements give nod disney for following their spectacular masterpiece mulan with this great animated adaption egar rice burrough tarzan

1 |text seen may 1999 the crossgates cinema guilderland theater with brother john for theater rating excellent seats sound and picture critic note this review the longest ever written and still only scratches the surface recommend this read only those who have seen the film form critical analysis friend and fellow film critic ted prigge said his review the phantom menace how even write this review never mind the fact that been waiting for new star wars movie since was seven years old never mind the fact everyone the internet had already dissected and discussed the movie before was even released never mind that there much going this movie terms plot action special effects and long term story that analyze every aspect would take lot time and energy and still wouldn cover everything and also like ted does all his reviews try review this way different from usual reviews and instead write casually possible was talking directly you the reader before can begin analyzing the specific aspects the film many the most general and most significant factors must considered get the specifics the film skip this and the next four paragraphs has been made obvious for the last several years another trilogy films will produced account for the missing initial three installments the star wars series the first the films was actually episode four not one george lucas the creator the series has probably just assumed most people know the first produced trilogy star wars the empire strikes back and return the jedi actually the second trilogy chronologically media interviews the past has explained why the movies were made out order but can recall his reasons with this new film writer and director has also assumed viewers are least vaguely familiar with the storylines and significant plot points the first trilogy err second trilogy well you know what mean and order for this review thorough many those significant points must mentioned which unfortunately may serve spoilers proceed with caution critic note one personal policy not intentionally analyze spoilers because would like reviews able make sense the reader both before and after viewing the film reviewed but would nearly impossible the film justice here without breaking the rule critic note reviewing this film also breaks the universal critics law reviewing movies which roger ebert coined not what movie about but how about because many outside factors come into play the film plot and significance part trilogy and just considering modern society again would difficult not impossible simply review the film completely autonomous story first all have catalog what know about the film before even going into know that young anakin skywalker will grow become the evil ruler darth vader who also the father luke skywalker who will lead successful revolution against him and his empire know obi wan ben kenobi was the trainer anakin the ways the force attempts become jedi knight but would fail and thus anakin would fall the dark side also know something about the force itself that some kind universal force which determines fate and can manipulated those whose minds are expanded enough believe and feel the jedi what don know for sure the history the ruling the galaxy which most likely much longer and more complex than any government have had here earth this was one the most fascinating aspects the first three films because there seemed subtle definite order all the complexity also seems that supposed familiar with few other details about the story which have come out the thousands comic books and paperbacks published the years since the movies ended most notably details regarding the emperor from empire and jedi and that was once senator and his last name palpatine for those who haven kept with all the star wars paraphernalia over the years there still way know these details simply recognizing actor his voice least with the phantom menace being the first chapter long saga one would assume the basic groundwork would laid including the history behind all the major factors the series especially the force and the jedi knights unfortunately this film does more the opposite simply builds top what must history long and detailed could never explained didn liked that aspect this film and one the reasons falls just short greatness you going tell story from the beginning tell from the beginning possible that after this trilogy complete there could another trilogy episodes through clarify the back story even further but digress said much and yet haven even touched the specifics the film itself all these necessary disclaiming elements should show just how vast the story the star wars series and this individual film itself what get here movie not unlike any the other three come know and love since the late 1970s its similarity the other films helps keep the spirit the series familiar but the same time seems flaw the filmmaking process itself since sometimes rings unoriginality the basic story rather sorted complex and even confusing times told that army known the trade federation has set blockade around seemingly insignificant planet called naboo not given too many details clarify the back story what the federation and what their purpose instead the film opts get its story moving quickly introduced two jedi the master qui gon jinn neeson and his apprentice obi wan kenobi mcgregor the two are acting ambassadors some sort hopes ending the obvious hostility between the federation and the planet queen amidala portman the leader the federation alien called viceroy following the orders strange mythical character older human man whose face and body are covered and shadowed the black robe and hood wears referred lord sidious but considering his appearance and especially that creepy evil voice his obviously one the most significant characters the series sidious communicates viceroy only through digital transmissions and never person clearly his actual whereabouts are something wants keep secret because that would also reveal his identity which never openly revealed the film but should clear most viewers have feeling delve into his background the next two films but doesn take the film long spring into action and within minutes our hero jedi are fighting for their lives and the film story begins move along the film doesn have one specific plot and works the same manner the other films the series where what get one mini plot and adventure top another there are many these mini plots within plots this film would not describe them all because what gives the movie its hook the other films have relied this type storytelling but because the limits the technology the time the films screenplays were also limiting the sense limitlessness here what gives the phantom menace its unique traits already know the film takes place least generation two before the original star wars trilogy which means lot the background which was unclear and unexplained may cleared here the beginning the vast epic story and here the most significant storyline that involving the discovery year old anakin skywalker lloyd qui gon jinn and his introduction the jedi council briefly summarize the story jinn stumbles upon skywalker attempt buy parts for queen amidala spaceship which was damaged efforts free her from the federation their meeting tatooine mostly chance but course jinn chalks the will the force jinn can feel that skywalker has great natural power the force and through another sub plot involving bet skywalker fantastic race will enter more and more details his significance begin reveal themselves this also provides for new elaboration and explanation the force which has never been mentioned before fact seems something important upsetting has never been mentioned before the element seriously undermines the mystical aspect the force and transforms into something more physical and scientific which completely unnecessary the film third act all the major significant elements become tied together rather familiar execution the plot funny how the reality the star wars world seems embedded mythology new age like philosophy and religion and yet the solution all the major conflicts the series has been violence not that this technique hasn been used movies and real life situations countless times throughout history and least

greatness many things the film seen before and done with more heart because the filmmakers concentrated just bit more story and character because they were limited but this film far from bad because least embraces the spirit sheer fun the movies

individual present when the superior officer comes within six paces the detail and dropped when the officer passes six paces from the detail any event the salute rendered only the man woman charge rather than the whole group almost the very beginning the general daughter see general motorcade passing work detail everyone salutes looked impressive but just wasn right that little bit showed that someone either didn the appropriate research made the conscious decision with style over substance for the scene fact this would serve metaphor for the rest the picture seems director simon west tried hard craft film with atmosphere and flash that forgot coherent story and good characterization are also crucial good movie what results film that looks good but like that one scene just isn right the first fifteen minutes the film good example paul brenner john travolta agent for the army criminal investigation division undercover georgia army base investigate illegal arms sale prior the

leslie stefanson found naked bound and dead one the base training ranges teamed with rape investigator sarah sunhill madeleine stowe uncover the truth about the peculiarly gruesome murder what want know why the whole action scene with the arms buyer was even necessary gives insight into brenner other than the fact that little cocky does the arms subplot turn later why add this extra running time the film the answer looked cool how about the atmosphere the beginning the general daughter presents with imagery the deep south thick trees dirt roads sultry colors over water all backed with bayouesque music nice immersion the setting but soon doesn matter for when the film plot shifts over the murder investigation does the entire mood attention paid the location the story and the music altered fit very generic thriller theme did the filmmakers start out thinking they were making different movie instead creating cohesive atmospheric theme for the entire film get the distraction one theme followed another just because the director thought should show off some the countryside the above examples also serve illustrate that inconsistency another problem with this movie already mentioned entire section the film doesn jibe with the rest and the characterization only adds the difficulty brenner who comes across man with little respect for authority suddenly snaps the presence general campbell james cromwell and utters some the corniest yes sir ever heard even delivers emotion charged monologue about why will work hard catch the person who killed the general daughter even though was totally flippant about the whole thing just couple minutes previous sunhill who initially comes across professional investigator utilizes couple blatantly illegal methods obtain information and even revels her ingenuity both characters are protagonists but hard get behind them when their personalities are all over the place and some cases simply unappealing could imagine that during filming west would shoot scene then take the actors aside and tell them let again but this time want more say this because although travolta and stowe are normally very good this film they overact most their scenes even worse offender clarence williams iii the general aide colonel fowler swear the guy says all his lines from the position attention far cry from his days linc the mod squad can help but think was acting from west direction couple side characters including west point psychologist john beasly and young female private ariyan johnson make their scenes nearly impossible bear the only two actors who seem have escaped west influence are james woods who provides good performance colonel moore elisabeth mentor the psychological operations unit and timothy hutton colonel kent the military police woods relishes the role man whose job playing with people minds and does without ever taking over the top hutton just kind hangs around but least wasn overacting haven read the nelson demille novel which this movie was based but bet more than few dollars that the story was better book form the movie version has got characters which come and with little nothing except fill space provide bits information which seem neither mean anything terms advancing the story nor reveal any significance once the whole story finished every time presented with some new aspect the case west gives more that flash playing like the most momentous discovery ever but the information not used the investigators all instead when conclusions are drawn they are such tremendous leaps faith that you wonder successful investigations are not based facts but lucky guesses instead the army should have saved time bringing brennan and sunhill letting them play game twenty questions with the suspects then letting them guess who the killer was would been over half hour the film finishes with sort bookend featuring the same style and southern scenery the very beginning literally during the closing credits get see brennan get his car and drive off then get see sunhill get her car and drive off they both seem kind happy maybe they were driving away from simon west

with first act and second act unlike many modern filmmakers has great deal restraint and refuses show the shark until the middle the second act until then merely suggests its presence with creepy subjective underwater shots and williams music building the tension bit bit when comes time for the climax the shark arrival truly terrifying doesn let get bored with the imagery the first act opens with police chief martin brody roy scheider new york cop who has taken easy peaceful job running the police station amity island fictitious new england resort town where there hasn been murder gun fired years the island shaken several vicious great white shark attacks right before the fourth july and the mayor larry vaughn murray hamilton doesn want shut down the beaches because the island reliant summer tourist money brody joined matt hooper richard dreyfuss young ambitious shark expert from the marine institute hooper fascinated the shark determined help brody stop his knowledge about the exact workings the shark perfect engine eating machine make that much more terrifying when vaughn finally relents hooper and brody join crusty old shark killer named quint robert shaw his decrepit boat the orca search for the shark the entire second act takes place the orca the three men hunt the shark and inevitably are hunted jaws thriller with keen sense humor and incredible sense pacing tension and horror like ten movies all rolled into one and wonder took america storm the summer 1975 taking enough money crown the box office champ all time until was unceremoniously dethroned 1977 star wars even today fascination with this film par with hitchcock psycho and never seems age although grand new technology exists that makes the technical sequences including several mechanical sharks obsolete none could improve the film because only would lead overkill the technical limitations faced spielberg 1975 may have actually produced better film because forced him rely traditional cinematic elements like pacing characterization sharp editing and creative photography instead simply dousing the audience with digital shark effects scheider dreyfuss and shaw were known actors the time jaws was made but none them had the draw robert redford paul newman nevertheless this film guaranteed them all successful careers because each gave outstanding performance and refused overshadowed the shark scheider hits just the right notes sympathetic husband and father caught the political quagmire doing what right and going against the entire town your first summer here you know mayor vaughn warns him dreyfuss who had previously been seen american graffiti 1973 and the apprenticeship duddy kravitz 1974 gives surprisingly mature complex performance for someone who had literally only played kids and teenagers however most outstanding the gnarled performance robert shaw the movie captain ahab performance sorely overlooked the academy awards bordering parody shaw plays quint grizzled old loner whose machismo borders masochism slightly deranged and shaw performance almost caricature however there one scene late the film when and brody and hooper are below deck the orca comparing scars quint drawn into telling the story his experiences aboard the indianapolis navy ship world war that was sunk the japanese his tale floating the water for more than week with over 000 other men while swarms sharks slowly devoured them them actually more hair raising than anything spielberg put screen shaw delivers the story one long take and the best acting the film course can leave out the shark itself with its black eyes endless rows teeth and insatiable urge eat basically the epitome all mankind fears about what unknown and threatening nature shark such perfect nemesis real having survived sinch the dinosaurs great whites exist they can large the shark jaws and they are threat every one spielberg subjective underwater shots makes feel queasy because lets see how look the shark bunch writihing dangling completely unprotected legs just ready chomped into the shark jaws was actually combination actual footage and five different mechanical sharks all nicknamed bruce the crew built shot from different angles many have forgotten but jaws was sort precursor waterworld 1995 movie who soggy production and cost overruns had universal studios worried about bomb but can see now spielberg overcame all the obstacles and delivered one the finest primal scare thrillers ever come out hollywood

1 |text like the wonderful 1990 drama awakenings starring robin williams and robert niro first sight directed irwin winkler inspired true story documented physicfirst sight directed irwin winkler inspired true story documented physician oliver sacks since awakenings was very good and made top ten list the year was released first sight not quite strong since not directed with sure hand penny marshall but still intelligent and vibrantly acted drama the film begins amy mira sorvino stressed out new york architect decides take some time off and travel upstate the country the hotel she staying she makes massage appointment and after long soothing session which ends with her crying release emotions she strikes conversation with the handsome masseur virgil val kilmer only find out later that actually blind amy doesn really care has handicap not and begins spend time with him more and more until they finally start fall love once she has returned new york amy begins research virgil certain type retinal blindness which has had since three years age and out stroke luck comes into contact with doctor bruce davison who believes can repair virgil sight even though there have only been thirty similar cases history first reluctant virgil finally travels with amy nyc and agrees the surgery much the hesitance his overbearing but loving older sister kelly mcgillis ultimately the surgery success but problems arise since virgil cannot relate what sees since has never visually seen anything before only touched objects moves into amy apartment and she eager stand him but virgil maladjustment begins put strain their relationship the basis the overall story first sight indeed film that has been done many times before and owes great deal its predecessor awakenings what will happen throughout the film can also easily telegraphed advance however what helps first sight rise above this predictability the mature and intelligent relationship that develops between virgil and amy usually romantic pictures are the shameless puppy dog sort the recent tom hanks meg ryan starrer you got mail immediately pops mind but with this film grew care more about the characters and their plight the film starts off noticably well amy travels north and first meets virgil the massaging sequences were strangely erotic maybe even more than the later actual love scenes and their romantic involvement quickly developed the film was both entertaining and sweet and there was clearly lot chemistry between the two these joyous moments early balanced out well with the later scenes which their relationship seriously tested due contrast the life styles that they have always known with virgil completely used being blind and having comforting peaceful life the country amy eventful life the big city the other major compliment that must given the film are the nearly flawless performances across the board val kilmer usually cast the macho type role was always believable blind person and playing his character was probably little more tricky than appears was kilmer not come off someone pity but sympathize with and pulled off mira sorvino who made spectacular debuting splash 1995 hilarious woody allen comedy mighty aphrodite for which she won well deserved oscar kind hearted but ditzy hooker standout here although she has made some mediocre film choices since then 1997 mimic 1998 the replacement killers she always has managed come out unscathed and with first sight that she finally has another juicy role play truthful climactic scene set amy apartment between she and virgil sorvino proves one the most gifted young actresses around today and has flare for both comedic and dramatic pieces kelly mcgillis who could have easily come off the bad one dimensional sister instead also given unexpectedly multifaceted character play woman who may overly protective but simply cares for her brother finally nathan lane who usually little too over the top appropriately restrained vision therapist the one misstep first sight its treatment the medical procedure done virgil very little ever said discussed concerning and when the surgery occurs briefly glimpsed that impossible see what being done his eyes perhaps the reason this aspect the film was not more depth was that the makers were afraid would gross out audiences but would personally take realism even graphic any day over simply giving the explanation the surgery the cold shoulder awakenings the patients and illness were far more satisfyingly portrayed because how strong the screenplay written steve levitt the way deals with the main relationship and because the fabulous performances from kilmer and sorvino the film few problems can swept over the side the adult way that the romance depicted director irwin winkler doubt respect the real life couple that the film was inspired who are still together after many years even though the setting the film was changed new york since january usually the time year that known the dumping ground from bad movies first sight comes refreshing and sophisticated change pace

-1 |text mandingo has traditionally been seen one two things either much needed revisionist look slavery the south the words film critic leonard maltin trashy potboiler that appeals only the crowd actually think mandingo strange combination the two although fails both fronts too trashy good drama but too dramatic good trash the story takes place dilapidated louisiana plantation run crotchety old warren maxwell james mason and his son hammond perry king one day new orleans hammond comes across slave trader selling mandingo named mede heavyweight boxer ken norton although the movie never explains mandingo simply the name for africans who come from the region the upper niger river valley according the movie mandingos were the rolls royce african slaves hammond pays top price for mede and has fight off others order get him hammond then spends his time training mede fighter money brawls with other slaves meanwhile hammond has married his cousin blanche susan george because she wants escape her family and under pressure from his father produce grandchild hammond however happier spending nights with his bed wench the derogatory name given female slaves used their masters for easy sex quickly apparent that hammond despite his overt racism more love with his bed wench sensitive slave girl named ellen brenda sykes than with blanche hammond considers blanche tainted goods because finds out their wedding night that another man had pleasured her before did course fine that slept with numerous slave girls but the fact that his wife white lady had been with another man out wedlock destroys his capacity care for her blanche usually left lonely and sex starved while hammond sleeping with ellen blanche gets back hammond seducing the studly mede and bearing his child hammond and his father cannot stand the idea that blanche has given birth half black child although okay that ellen was pregnant hammond warren kills the child letting bleed death after birth and hammond poisons blanche hammond then finds mede shoots him twice the shoulder and pushes him into giant cauldron boiling water yes you read right the film ends with hammond getting his revenge boiling mede alive judging only the plot mandingo pure sexploitation the main purpose the film seems getting many blacks and whites into bed together possible with only the slightest commentary what that would mean 19th century southern society when mandingo was released 1975 was still bit shocker see miscegenation screen such graphic detail this way the movie could revise cinematic history while attracting large audiences curious voyeurs dramatically mandingo weak and unfocused and historically mostly confused one were judge history this film would easy walk away with the notion that the entire system american slavery was based sexuality not economics not once the film see any the slaves working except for few house servants the men spend most the time sitting around while the sole purpose female slave seems free sex for the owner there historical basis the notion that slave owners often slept with their female slaves but mandingo overwhelming emphasis this aspect slavery gives the movie the unpleasant taste cheap sex flick although there plenty violence fights vicious beatings shootings and the aforementioned human boiling sequence thrown for good measure some tried write off mandingo blaxploitation film one number quickly made low budget films appealing black sensibilities the early seventies but not that easy mandingo was studio financed paramount pictures and produced dino laurentiis the grandiose italian producer behind such notorious productions the bible 1966 the remake king kong 1976 and the ill fated dune 1984 the director was richard fleischer veteran who was best known for several special effects laden action movies including 000 leagues under the sea 1954 and fantastic voyage 1966 well such superior suspense films the narrow margin 1952 the script based the supermarket best seller ken ostott and the subsequent play jack kirkland was penned norman wexler who had been nominated for oscar two years earlier for his work serpico james mason perry king and susan george were well known and respected actors mason already had three oscar nominations under his belt and ken norton appeared have promising film career why mandingo bad number reasons including the fact that all those experienced filmmakers behind and front the camera did lousy job wexler script pure poor hokum bordering the offensive combines stereotyped slave talk yessuh massuh stereotyped southern white trash talk fer whut you gittin outta bed and stereotyped contemporary militant black talk you see hang you gonna know you killed black brother fleischer direction clumsy especially during the fight scenes and all the actors give weak performances especially susan george whose constant shrieking finally becomes laughable nevertheless credit should given where credit due despite its exploitative nature mandingo was one the first hollywood movies take alternative look slavery until then there had been kind underlying racism all hollywood films dealing with slavery even classics such gone with the wind 1939 can seen inherently racist its glossing over the subject matter mandingo reassessed the south and showed that wasn all beautiful plantations green fields and pretty sunsets but all this constantly undermined the film negligible point view claims see things from the black perspective but the entire narrative focus the soap opera tales the white owners with little more maturity and different handling mandingo might have been effective worthwhile film while portrays many sensitive aspects slavery never deals with them the issues the movie brings are worthwhile but wexler script refuses move them beyond surface level trashily vicarious viewing there great deal potential honestly exploring the nature sexual relationship between slave and owner but mandingo never does steven spielberg touched that same topic schindler list 1993 looking nazi officer writhing inner turmoil because his feelings for jewish maid the difference between that film and mandingo that spielberg dealt with the situation fair unexploitive manner that focused the inherent human dilemma mandingo satisfied simply show some skin and because that its trashy potboiler nature overshadows any potential social good might have accomplished

1 |text maybe the most important thing about this movie that not handled like the hallmark hall fame movie the month because very well could have been manipulative tearjerker broadcasted abc monday night starring kelly martin and yasmeen bleeth respectively because not handled like the greatest story ever told precisely why great underneath the die for cinematography the brilliant acting and incessantly wonderful direction film modesty not sure whether not this story totally great but with the balls run with tell certain original way doesn merely from plot point plot point goes from character character obsesses itself with the depth and the style all and makes the story world reknowned cellist who contracts and dies prematurely into the story two sisters both musicians who have totally unique relationship that their relationship the center the story that makes this film transcend any cornball shamelessly tired tearjerker qualities could have had and makes this unlike patch adams effortlessly emotional and real short this movie just awesome merely tells its story really well and that something that just has commended these days when most stories are botched because they not told great storytellers director anand tucker tells this story well overdramaticizes everything but still keeps real the film tells the story hilary and jacqueline rachel griffiths and emily watson respectively two sisters who are first seen childhood played auriol evans and keely flanders respectively the very best friends they are also both musicians hilary flutist and jackie cellist and when all begins both are considered child prodigies but hilary seen the better the two jackie bit jealous works and works her playing skills and soon the tables are turned when they both hit adulthood hilary strives for comeback while her sister playing famous halls around the world but instead fame captures the heart hapless joyful conductor kiffer finzi david morissey semi star making turn they marry after short courtship and move lovely country house making jackie incredibly jealous since her cello playing becomes symbol her current life when she plays she has the eyes the world but when she stops she alone she enters into shallow relationship with equally famous pianist daniel barenboim james frain hopes that she may overcloud her sister but she eventually begins lose and runs away hilary country home where she hopes gain admittance hilary sleep with her husband since one she sleeps with gives her any pleasure all terribly melodramtic you can see and the time jackie has contracted brilliantly edited scene that surpasses the breakdown scene the semi smiliar shine technical and emotional devastation would have been the time that could easily call the sign for melodramatic overload hadn been handled such way the key thing here that not about her gradual death and slip into insanity but rather that about her tumultuous relationship with her sister which might add perfectly realized their relationship the most down earth complex entity the year they love eachother more than anyone else the entire world but they also completely jealous one another when young jackie surpasses her playing abilities she tries vain make comeback but can and almost seems marry get back jackie for her success when jackie lands top and sees her sister marry wonderful man she jealous her lifestyle the most extensive brinks that ever seen film only two sisters who truly love eachother would dare share the same man and the whole time their love for eachother never doubted even tested another thing really liked emily watson performance usually make note never overpraise actor for playing either drunkard lunatic someone with mortal disease any combination the three reasoning for this that fucking easy job the worst case for this very year may thandie newton beloved sure she good but what tough about playing woman who stumbles around slurs her words together and acts like three year old inside year old body hell could play that had pair breasts that same exact movie though performance kimberly elise where she has the rock that holds the family together her mother slowly goes insane her brothers run off never seen again and her mother lover scared off she has actually deal with real emotions something much harder than mere stumbling about but the academy arts and sciences loves loves loves overpraising performances like newtons you don believe look jack nicholson performance good gets great performance but easy job this isn for watson though because her insanity comes from real emotions not just plot point and thanks the opening sequence where see her and hilary kids understand the motives behind all her actions and the time she actually contracts and begins loose her sanity and her life already understood that this the last straw for woman plagued with terrible neuroses rachel griffiths who would have otherwise been the understudy watson protagonist actually matches watson step for step because watson grows insane and demands unspeakable things from her griffiths holds her own and has deal with what she able give her sister who needs emotional help from her griffiths otherwise unknown actress and watson being famous from breaking the waves and the boxer absolutely brilliant just absolutely brilliant watson and the academy and all the other critics groups who already deemed watson performance the best the year glance over hers because she the one who doesn get insane read she gets the boring role then the scream hysteria you hear will from after all griffiths has the thankless job keeping things real the tom cruise role rainman the one who should have gotten oscar consideration and not hoffman she does and anyone deserves accolades from the academy this year griffiths together the two actresses work extremely well though and both have through deep emotional hell the likes which haven been seen this year hadn been for otherwise not totally great final section that deals way too much with jackie and not enough with hilary when the two had gotten equal treatment for the entirety say this one the top ten best films the year close perfection its structure its treatment its subject and its beautiful technical specifications cinematography nomination without shred doubt mind and maybe film editing that nearly shame that not the flawless gem that should but hey can hardly complain

-1 |text seemed like the perfect concept what better for the farrelly brothers famous for writing and directing comedies with offensive subject matter than make movie about guy with split personality exactly the sort thing the brothers relish poking fun something serious this case mental illness throwing all care the wind get laugh jim carrey signed too even better the national alliance for the mentally ill even helped out levying complaints against the brothers new film before its opening claiming was misrepresenting the condition split personality labeling incorrectly schizophrenia and forth such protest seemed like just the sort thing that would course only add more fuel the farrelly brothers fire proving that some people just couldn take joke and that the farrellys would helping the more enlightened viewers yet another dose their brilliantly subversive comedy yes all seemed perfect but one thing went wrong their movie isn funny not for lack trying the farrellys utilize myself irene their most high concept premise ever carrey plays charlie baileygaites man who after being dumped his wife for midget limo driver decides bury all his aggressive feelings deep down inside and never release them this course means all his neighbors exploit his entirely too forgiving nature making his job rhode island state trooper increasingly difficult soon enough charlie repressed aggression manifests itself into second independent personality named hank deep voiced boorish ogre unafraid taking the assertive actions his predecessor had been unable muster this guy isn above crashing car through the wall the barber shop which been insulted holding little girl head underwater because she refused stop jump roping the street then things start getting lost the most complicated plot the farrellys have ever attempted and the film runs off its tracks some have suggested that this isn problem because the farrelly brothers brand humor doesn require plot work they wrong course plot was greatly instrumental building the kind rollicking comic energy that infused the farrellys last effort 1996 there something about mary 1999 outside providence was technically earlier project the brothers earlier film wasn funny merely because contained outrageous gags despite what some newsmagazine articles would have you believe but rather because its most outrageous gags were entirely unexpected mary the farrellys managed several times pull off neat sleight hand trick they have you thinking the story was going one way then reveal its real direction delightfully surprising fashion myself irene contrast seems have been made folks who looked mary and saw only the surface grossness missing all the subtle machinations that really made work having been produced the same guys who made mary irene seems like even bigger disappointment the brothers pile the offensive humor taking shots race midgets albinos mental illness and all manner bathroom jokes but they haven come with way make any fresh most myself irene comes off rote the numbers adolescent comedy the plot with carrey forced drive alleged fugitive irene waters renee zellweger who more trouble than anyone knows back new york has ending that entirely predictable from the get think charlie and irene will fall love yeah too the farrellys then introduce scores different characters and none them ever manage anything you haven already expected them matter how outrageous their actions might compared the curveballs the farrellys are used throwing this stuff almost entirely soft tossed presenting obvious problem when gross out humor loses its shock value longer funny merely gross the jokes that work are milked over and over until their effectiveness runs dry take for example the subplot involving charlie three black sons anthony anderson mongo brownlee jerod mixon the incongruity all funny for while with three burly black men discussing higher math ghetto language and white bread carrey mouthing said language with entirely too pleasant smile his face but the end the film they still doing the same schitck hasn been elevated another funnier level and hasn been dropped either that too bad because ceases amusing about halfway through myself irene reeks wasted opportunities there ought more focus how other people react charlie new personality and how charlie deals with the consequences hank actions this doesn really happen nearly every supporting character learns about charlie condition early they don have any opportunity surprised the film throws what looks like patented farrelly curve scene towards the midway point involving albino companion charlie and irene pick called appropriately whitey but the script doesn anywhere with instead leaving the thread twisting the wind before awkwardly tying during the climax jim carrey gifted comedian both physically and vocally but left with nothing much here except contort himself manner similar steve martin all great showcase flexibility and split second role shifting but none terribly funny carrey doesn pull any stunts don expect him pull and the farrellys script doesn give him anything else pull the situations which must perform the role shifting aren set any meaningful way perhaps carrey can take solace the fact that his supporting actors fare better zellweger irene not strong female lead mary mary may have been part adolescent fantasy but she was also intelligent and strong willed irene nothing particular the film never makes clear whether she ditzy clever neither such she gives nothing latch onto the only sane person the film chris cooper stuck playing exactly one note corrupt fbi agent and his character entirely too straight laced for movie like this like the others does absolutely nothing unexpected after viewing the shapeless mess that myself irene eventually dissolved into was stuck wondering whether not the farrellys had outsmarted themselves maybe their kind comedy can only work for long until audiences get wise and stop being shocked but don believe good filmmakers find ways surprising their audiences even after people have grown attuned their style the farrellys are indeed good smart filmmakers and still think they are they rebound just fine even after that happens though still consider myself irene high caliber misfire

childish expressions like that was the funnest movie ever seen hell with webster chicken run one the funnest movies seen while can remember the last time seen anything funner the chickens tweedy farm are something living concentration camp like atmosphere they are led one plucky hen called ginger voice julia sawalha who continually comes with plans for escape and always gets caught subsequently spending day after day the coal box one night brash american rooster flies over the fence calling himself rocky mel gibson famous flying rooster and circus performer rocky promises teach the chickens how fly and the situation grows more desperate the nefarious mrs tweedy miranda richardson decides abandon the farm egg selling plan for pie selling plan she orders huge pie making machine cackling chickens pies come out what sort pies chicken pies course director nick park and his studio aardman animation produced three oscar winning short films creature comforts the wrong trousers and close shave the latter two were the second and third installments trilogy starring the delightful team wallace gromit man and his dog famous for getting themselves into increasingly peculiar adventures part what made the wallace films brilliantly entertaining was park uncanny ability make old story seem new the wrong trousers for example pulled out lot old hitchcockian suspense tricks and close shave owed great deal inspiration classic detective stories but the hands park and his team the stories felt fresh and inspired and not the least bit contrived now teaming with director peter lord park has created similar creature chicken run the plot largely lifted from the great escape watch for quick reference the ball bouncing scene with some spielberg inspired action sequences providing the excitement thing the film doesn feel like been lifted from somewhere else chicken run feels fresh alive like nothing else ever done part the original idea who the world came with the idea make prisoners war movie starring chickens park and lord milk the incongruity for all worth the characters treat their situation were dead serious and them but they chickens funny another thing that helps chicken run and most park films succeed the animators subtle way giving nods the very films they cribbing there are references the great escape obviously and stalag the chase sequence inside the chicken grinder parodies both raiders the lost ark and indiana jones and the temple doom there even nod the blues brothers you can believe and the filmmakers even get little light hearted ribbing the expense their star voice actor taking couple very subtle jabs mel gibson nationality and film history the braveheart reference hoot you catch when you consider just how fine line resides between funny parody and redundant one chicken run downright brilliant its execution consider this since july last year seen dozens upon dozens blair witch project parodies television the radio and online out all those maybe one two were amusing the rest tiresome why because once you got past the thought that they parodying that 8216 blair witch movie most the parodies had nothing offer insight original idea greater purpose they were only funny you had seen the movie otherwise you got nothing conversely chicken run doesn lean its parodies the film references are never the sole focus any scene you never seen indiana jones the chase sequence still fun even you have idea who mel gibson rocky remains interesting character park lord and screenwriter karey kirkpatrick realize that audience does not need parody shoved their faces before understood and result chicken run filled with visual and verbal jabs that are never too obvious but not quite vague either enjoyment this movie doesn require knowledge film history but you got chicken run that much richer the voice cast turns uniformly lively performances and the characters they play are given many subtle nuances that hard not fall love with every one them ginger perfect spunky and opinionated but with soft heart that forbids her leave her companions behind and julia sawalha known the cute mousy girl absolutely fabulous nails she has warm human chemistry with gibson whose rocky hides his personal doubt under brash gung veneer the characters inevitable romance doesn feel contrived but sweet poor tweedy tony haygarth suspects the chickens are organizing some way but his limited intellect prevents him from figuring things out and his overbearing wife certainly isn any help jane horrocks delivers lovely voice characterization tragically optimistic babs hen that runs away with most the best one liners all while perpetually crocheting sweater and two supply trading rats that seem have walked straight out monty python sketch nearly steal the show during the lively central swing dancing sequence they even come with inspired riff something that baffled scholars and theologians alike for decades the chicken egg dilemma one might have expected this inevitable joke come off wearisome but with most chicken run comes delightful surprise the film manages cross all barriers should accessible both children and adults brits and yanks rats and chickens the animation first rate remember that this was all done the old fashioned way with actual humans moving clay figurines around tiny set bit painstaking bit and you see just how truly remarkable chicken run really this movie possesses that same quality that makes pixar studios animation great precise and unwavering attention detail such top notch family fare bug life toy story chicken run has something offer nearly every frame certainly passive viewer can enjoy straightforward story with worthwhile moral and some surprisingly touching scenes but active attentive viewers will enjoy even more because they catch all the details anyway the movie just boatload fun funnest damn movie seen all year

begun and almost twenty years before the rodney king incident its violent and highly sexualized revenge tale macho black hustler fighting back against white oppression and winning was something that had never been seen american movie screen before style content and how was conceived and produced sweet sweetback was cinematic revolution whether not one agrees with its subject matter van peebles black american who first gained recognition writing novels france built sweet sweetback from the ground almost entirely himself because studio would dare fund such film was forced raise all the money himself the movie ended costing about 500 000 part which was put none other than bill cosby van peebles cut costs hiring non union labor and taking most the film responsibilities himself wrote the script scored the music edited and directed the film well starred the central role was also brilliant entrepreneur who always found way make extra buck for instance when the mppa slapped the film with dreaded rating van peebles not only threatened bring lawsuit against jack valenti and the mpaa but also developed little marketing scheme coined the phrases rated all white jury which put the movie posters help advertise the film also printed the phrase tee shirts which had problem selling the storyline sweet sweetback deceptively simple takes place los angeles and van peebles stars the title character tough male hustler few words who grew brothel and makes money doing what does best having sex one day agrees with couple amiable white cops down the station make look like they bringing suspects politically charged case involving murder however the way the station the cops arrest young black revolutionary named hubert scales who they proceed beat viciously acting out complete impulse rather than political motivation sweetback fights back and beats the cops the brink death the rest the film follows sweetback evades the cops his way eventual escape mexico although the repetition watching sweetback run gets little old the end the film this plot allows van peebles camera roam the darker side the ghettos alleys and back street whorehouses that other films had always overlooked van peebles entire point making the movie was secure celluloid vision the black experience america that other filmmakers had ignored the beginning sweet sweetback offers this epigraph which traditional prologue used medieval times when messenger brought bad news sire these lines are not homage brutality that the artist has invented but hymn from the mouth reality van peebles wanted make sure that his vision was one reality not exaggeration course with today abundance rap and hip hop music that sings the same ode black inner city life well films spike lee john singleton and the hughes brothers sweet sweetback doesn seem all that revolutionary important remember that this film must viewed the context and time period which was made that time sweet sweetback was controversial that only two theaters the entire united states would play distributors were petrified film that van peebles words gave the black audience chance see some their own fantasies acted out about rising out the mud and kicking ass course once caught caught big sweet sweetback now considered the film that kicked off the blaxploitation era although van peebles disassociates sweetback from other movies like shaft 1972 and the mack 1973 because those were financed big hollywood studios sweet sweetback also the only film deemed mandatory viewing the black panthers however even when viewed from african american perspective sweet sweetback certainly not without its controversies when was first released article was published ebony magazine denouncing the film while the same time the black panthers used entire newsletter praise there have been arguments that the victory for sweetback really victory all beating cops and then running away mexico nothing proud others have pointed out that sweetback has little say throughout the film has political motivations and therefore the violence and havoc wreaks not rooted fundamental beliefs but personal and selfish motives still others point the clich black potency that stereotypes sweetback being good nothing but having sex illustrated scene where gains the respect white biker group bringing their female leader orgasm nevertheless movie like sweet sweetback cannot made without conflicting points view revolutionary movie not because about one man defiance but because put front and center black issues that had never been dealt with before until that point american cinema was almost exclusively white domain and with the exception sidney poitier all black actors were relegated specifically black roles that were important only relation whites the fact that sweet sweetback was movie black about blacks was something new the opening credits van peebles lists the starring actors simply the black community van peebles tells interesting story that goes long way toward defining the difference between sweet sweetback and all movies that had come before when the movie first opened saw theater next older woman near the end the film when sweetback wounded the police and stumbling through the southern california desert she kept saying herself lord let him die don let them kill him let him die his own was ingrained her mind that death was imminent for any african american movie who rebelled against white authority that she couldn even conceive the possibility that the film might end with his successful escape and course sweetback does escape and the screen fills with the message watch out baad asssss nigger coming back collect some dues beyond the political aspects sweet sweetback entertaining picture which van peebles always intended squeezed every drop out his limited budget and produced film that although dated now was technically fantastic the time shot rough documentary like fashion while also utilizing almost every visual and aural trick his technology would allow him makes good use older techniques like split screens freeze frames reversed color schemes and overlapping images the only time the film ever looks bad during the night sequences because van peebles simply did not have the needed equipment watching sweet sweetback more than twenty five years after its initial release one realizes that still has bite arguments can made that race relations the united states have made quantum leaps since the early seventies but there are still problems that are reflected this film but there more the film than its racial aspect the legacy sweet sweetback baadasssss song not only the plentiful amount art and music told from the african american perspective but more importantly the work every artist who has fought fund and produce that which important him

tomes stranger strange land robert heinlein childhood end arthur clarke and man the high castle and androids dream electric sheep philip dick all deal with man need for identity and struggle for self worth hollywood has regularly adapted the milieu not the message science fiction since beginnings most films just created fancy pulp tales with more thought that the escapism they achieved really wasn until producer george pal took charge robert heinlein novel rocketship galileo and crafted the film destination moon that sci commonly referred came into own from there such diverse filmmakers roger corman stanley kubrick have sought express ideas through the medium the genre with the release touchstone pictures mission mars have unabashedly nonchalant sci film for those who read the national enquirer and the globe the film opens summer barbecue phil ohlmyer jerry connell woos young female with his tales space glory and the upcoming mission woody blake tim robbins and his wife terri connie nielsen commit his coming authority the mission and luc goddard don cheadle consoles his son entering the party jim mcconnell gary sinise who gave command the mission due the untimely death his wife maggie kim delaney luc consoles jim with woody assistance the three men are friends and carry fine bond trust and caring between them but jim still longs set foot the red planet the mission earnest luc and his team land the cydonia region mars they send out the rover investigate the area and discover what seems water ice under the surface going out investigate luc and his team approach the famed

station orbiting earth woody and jim receive the information that the mars landing team missing luc interference laden emergency message urges the two men attempt second mission the red planet the hopes rescuing the previous team the second journey the martian world fraught with danger meteorite showers explosions and rescues all come into play the intrepid heroes make there way the planet surface the big question there now has there ever been intelligent life mars and what its relationship with now for the bad news the entire plot mission mars based almost wholeheartedly outdated and preposterous national enquirer type martian civilization tripe the famed face mars becomes the centerpiece the film revealing some the most harebrained sci pabulum the screen has witnessed borrowing ideas from such films robinson crusoe mars 1964 quatermass and the pit 1967 2001 space odyssey and even mario bava planet the vampires terrore nello spazio 1965 mission mars hodgepodge ideas that don add satisfying whole while some sequences are wonderfully handled and executed the film remains flat and involving much time giving establishing the lead characters the film but good use the performances are all workmen like with only don cheadle luc carrying any sort real chemistry gary sinise wasted role that requires him look experiencing sleep depravation and the mistaken idea having jerry connell phil ohlmyer play his part for comic relief just too painful excuse and the less said about tim robbins called from home performance the better just having too much fun here give damn the script has few lapses namely that after discovering several breaches the hull the ship caused meteorite shower one thinks checking the fuel tanks the remainder the ship for damage this course leads our heroes having abandon their rescue ship also when one character sacrifices himself the character takes religious demeanor that completely odds with the situation but the biggest offence the film the horrid intrusive score ennio morricone subtlety non existent here fact some scenes the music becomes extravagant that dialogue almost drowned out the only sequence which the score almost works during the protracted meteorite shower the pacing the film very leisurely after the opening introduction the characters which lasts full minutes are finally dropped onto the martian surface then there another long pause the plot for more character development including elaborate dance sequence zero gravity the film could lose about minutes and actually gain some momentum there are many scenes talking heads discussing what already know going happen that drags the film dead stop the good news that the film absolutely sumptuous look the vistas the planet mars are majestic and awe inspiring the design the numerous spacecraft and suits are all expertly drafted with level realism that hasn been seen since 2001 space odyssey the visual effects are just stunning from the space walk sequences the visualization evolution earth the only fault come with the martians themselves which look more like something out plastic model kit than something from another world director palma stages some wonderfully creative scenes through out the film the opening sequence alone seemingly interrupted cut lasting almost minutes homage hitchcock rope are introduced all the characters scenes the rescue ship with its rotating centrifuge are just amazing their execution but the nagging question the final explanation worth all this sturm und drang sadly not director brian palma has crafted extravagant production the set design and visual effects are all arresting but the comic strip denouncement that ruin what might have been fine return good adventurous thought provoking science fiction disappointing film but one that might still entertain you can settle for the visuals

1 |text ever wonder what happened gabe kaplan you remember was the title character that sitcom welcome back kotter always trying help out the sweathogs frequently trying dodge woodman ever wary his wife tuna casserole you ask where now kaplan actually spends much his time these days playing professional high stakes poker that right not sure his main source income but from what heard the guy occasionally comes away with 000 time and there you were thinking was going tell you was doing off broadway theater you silly goose well gabe kaplan isn the movie rounders nor the film about the actor come gambler life but rounders about poker and gabe plays poker and thought that was kind neat connection sorry about the segue lack thereof matt damon plays mike mcdermott law student who also has singular talent for the game poker been playing for while and more than being proficient has caught the bug goes all the underground games new york city knows the regulars and knows how win the beginning the film built nice thirty grand nest egg which takes the speakeasy type gaming parlor where the big boys play mike there make his bid into the upper echelon staking all against teddy kgb john malkovich oreo munching cardshark with ties the russian mafia mike has the potential take large pot and vegas and buy into the world series poker but instead loses all single hand months later paying his way through law school driving delivery truck when mike best friend and poker buddy worm edward norton finishes his jail term for hustling some students wants pick right were they left off working team part others with their betting cash although mike has stopped playing cards promise his girlfriend and fellow law student gretchen mol worm connives mike into playing once more and mike bitten again the bug slides down that slippery slope risking his relationship education and reputation playing poker again becomes the focus his life make film about gambling filmmaker will usually have play the glamorous side get the audience behind the characters this because few moviegoers will care whole lot about some guy leisure suit terry cloth shirt sitting folding card table with stogie his mouth rounders however seems more for the latter than the former the card clubs mike and worm frequent aren very glamorous all there basement lodge with elk heads the wall goulash joint these are the kinds locales which director john dahl sets his shots except for one brief instance when the two players visit atlantic city the film bereft the flashing lights the casinos the pleasant color the green felt table the reason rounders still captures our attention because less about the game poker than about the personalities which enjoy and are slaves given nice set interesting characters with clear motivations and good actors play them matt damon very natural mike who struggles between his desire play the straight and narrow finishing law school and answering what may his true calling playing professional poker norton worm truly worm always looking for the angle and playing everyone for what they worth john turturro who amazes with his acting range tones down this film playing joey knish virtual poker prodigy his time who now plays the underground games make rent and child support payments both friend and mentor mike and turturro low key performance totally convincing just john malkovich heavily accented teddy kgb imposing adversarial dragon mike must slay prove himself martin landau also thrown into the mix one mike law professors abe petrovsky while landau slips well into the role his character spitting out personal anecdotes about staying true one self facilitates the channeling the storyline toward predictable ending perhaps the weak link the otherwise formidable line acting talent however gretchen mol who just didn seem have much presence screen she genuine peach look kind cross between actress renee zellweger and singer jewel and wouldn surprised the three them formed some kind blond haired triumvirate and attempted take over the world but her delivered lines seemed very flat and found myself looking for matt damon reactions instead good thing about rounders that doesn get bogged down the character development and statement making much that can find time for humor the film peppered nicely with scenes that both make you laugh and keep the pacing going such sequence where mike and worm move rapidly around new york from one game the next widely different locales one game cigar club had stitches love the sweetness this dark maduro wrapper says one the players clearly more interested displaying his pretentiousness over the cigar one hand than the cards his other was hoping mike and worm would really take these guys with all the poker being played rounders had the potential very confusing you might think you know lot about poker but think again luckily given narration damon during the more intricate moments explain what going the narrations are more informative than intrusive and apprise what the stakes are and why certain players want the things they nice that the characters develop does our comprehension their world film about success and survival the realm underground poker rounders delivers spades wait film about the culture cards rounders ace hang packed with great acting and great characters rounders full house okay guess that enough the way you ever want get into game with gabe kaplan sure bring note from epstein mother

1 |text there are some works art that are almost impossible review not because their own complexity but because their legendary status which prevents the reviewer say anything original one such masterpieces casablanca probably not the best film the history the seventh art but definitely the most popular one its popularity can measured not multitude more less disguised remakes that were made more than half century since its premiere but also countless tributes and references that movie makers use their works this day casablanca also movie that has the very rare virtue both being praised the critics and loved general audience one the things that makes this film even more unique was the fact that was doomed fail least judging conventional movie making wisdom its time was based broadway play mediocre that hadn been produced stage screenplay three writers julius epstein philip epstein and howard koch was beeing written shooting went along the main actors were producers second choice and finally man behind camera michael curtiz was considered capable but not great director however the movie was commercially successful and earned three oscars including the one for the best film until this very day considered the best example hollywood film making its own golden age the plot the movie was heavily influenced the needs ww2 propaganda yet also used rather complicated and now almost forgotten political circumstances that global conflict order make intriguing story december 1941 casablanca exotic port the atlantic coast north africa controlled officially neutral yet nazi collaborating french vichy government thousands refugees from war torn europe are stuck there the way lisbon and safety america and ready pay any price for precious exit visas many shady characters thrive their misery including the corrupt police chief captain renault rains his best friend rick blaine bogart who used idealistic anti fascist and now owns popular night club casablanca and lives his own cynical philosophy sticking his neck for nobody however everything changes when gets possession two precious extra visas this event coincides with the arrival two new refugees casablanca one them victor laszlo henreid czech resistance leader who escaped three times from nazi concentration camps and became the legend enslaved europe accompanied his beautiful wife ilsa lund bergman with whom rick had stormy affair the eve nazi occupation paris the couple needs visas especially because the gestapo major strasser veidt being their trail rick now forced choose between love wounded pride self preserving interest and his own hatred fascism the casting for this movie seems influenced divine inspiration humphrey bogart most legendary actor the history cinema one the rare character actors who elevated his persona the star status bogart portrayal rick complicated man torn between idealistic past and bitter present was perfect that his icon would forever connected with that character another icon his company ingrid bergman great actress old hollywood here her artistic and visual prime the cinematic coupling bogart and bergman became one the main symbols that era filmmaking some happier times when the romance the screen didn look childish nor trite like some more contemporary works for many people casablanca probably the best romantic film ever made but the reason for that isn the romance itself the realistic story people forced make tough and often wrong choices their life the casting casablanca was right target not just case main leads the supporting actors also did marvellous job sidney longstreet and peter lorre were here mainly give mystic flavour spotted previous bogart classic john huston maltese falcon yet both them managed portray colourful and original characters another shining example good casting now almost forgotten paul henreid the weakest part love triangle character victor laszlo has believable charisma and looks like somebody who could inspire millions people rise against nazi tiranny unfortunately the charisma that burdened laszlo leaves little place for difficult choice making his character forever overshadowed rick ilsa coupling however rick and ilsa actually have serious competiton for most memorable character casablanca captain renault brilliantly portrayed claude rains role lifetime was embodiment perfect almost unmatched balance between ethical corruption and physical charm despite being the undoubtful villain almost entire movie rains managed make renault sympathetic character and his final conversion the side good symbolized not subtle gesture the end movie looked unnecessary rains also gave another dimension the movie making even more ambiguous people who like analyse movies death discovered signs homosexuality renault relationship towards rick and rick final words leave room for even more outrageous speculations together with well drawn characters and exciting story the movie was good creating his own atmosphere professional nitpickers would probably have field day discovering numerous historical and geographical inaccuracies but casablanca still shining example hollywood ww2 movie that beliavable not realistic any way even don see historical document casablanca movie that can source entertainment well infinite inspiration

-1 |text time take cover after hiatus about fifteen years the disaster movie has come back with renewed zest early 1997 there were less than three movies about volcanoes alone one television and two the theaters with dante peak and volcano heavy competition for the moviegoing dollar the two had heard that dante peak was the better film decided check out when was released video the film begins with slow motion scene people third world country trying evacuate their little town the town being covered ash and sulfuric water from what presume volcanic eruption flaming rocks various sizes also fall from the sky crushing homes and people see people panicking people crying and even horses rearing disaster biblical proportions signified one person dragging cross down road symbolism doesn get much more blatant than that learn that harry dalton pierce brosnan volcanologist with the geological survey was there with his wife when the eruption occurred harry survived but his wife did not few years later harry sent investigate some unusual seismic activity detected near the small town dante peak washington which are told has been voted second most desirable place live under 000 the readers money magazine there harry meets rachel wando single mother two who serves mayor dante peak and proprietor small coffee shop although the mayor doesn seem alarmed the presence man sent determine the mountain next their town going blow few members the city council are they are afraid that harry presence going scare off investor who has pledged put millions dollars into developing dante peak they would rather have any news possible stirrings within the neighboring dormant volcano swept under the rug however when amorous young couple takes skinny dip the local hot springs they turn cooked lava which bubbles from small fissure underneath thus begins chain events leading the inevitable eruption this film contains number cliches the amorous couple one soon they doff their clothes you know they going die the town busybody and the abrasive mother law make appearances does the death defying dog countless familiar scenarios only serve make this film very predictable watching the movie was able not only anticipate each the major plot elements but some the dialogue well unfortunate since much the dialog terrible for example harry boss paul charles hallahan and team from the geological survey join harry assess the situation paul basically tells the townsfolk that harry eruption predictions aren cause for alarm this causes harry leave fit rage only turn the next day ready for work when paul asks harry why stayed says with grim determination cause this town trouble and the best man you got even better when harry trying explain the need jolt the residents into leaving likens the situation how frog will jump out dropped into pot boiling water the frog cold water which gradually heated however the frog won move and will allow itself cooked that your recipe for frog soup asks one the team members recipe for disaster responds harry dante peak has singular talent for pointing out the obvious our heroes are boat the middle lake which harry realizes the volcanic activity has turned acid mayor wando demonstrates her brilliant powers deduction proclaiming very grave tone acid eats metal thanks for the tip when first see the geological survey building there caption labeling such this wouldn have been bad weren for the fact that the caption right above sign the building which reads large letters geological survey suppose the caption for people who can read signs although harry and mayor wando become item the end the film the viewer has idea why there severe lack chemistry between the two characters and the relationship seems rushed because this when they get close kissing was asking myself why they want kiss were they even attracted each other were the mayor would sure think twice about kissing guy who doesn even crack smile through the whole movie trying pull off the rough yet debonair act who does think james bond the eruption the volcano feels similarly rushed there are several warning signs prior the eruption itself but they are lackluster and without suspense that don feel they are leading anything for example one the survey team members makes his way down into the crater the volcano order retrieve remote controlled robot tremor occurs does plunge headlong his death engulfed lava which shoots from below couple rocks fall him and break his leg the sole purpose this scene seemed set the subsequent chopper rescue scene which suppose was intended dramatic well wasn one plot thread left noticeably hanging was the investment the town dante peak disaster movie there usually one guy who greedy enough cover the possibility eruption fire earthquake explosion tsunami tornado meteorite and usually gets killed the disaster okay course because all think got what deserved you going unoriginal you might well all the way dante peak the city councilmembers are concerned but they don really try hard enough maybe the mayor abrasive mother law should have been the one for apparent reason she snaps harry for even positing that the volcano could erupt perhaps her ancestors invested some pompeii real estate there are couple good things about this movie the first the scenery there are panoramic shots forests lakes and mountains that are absolutely beautiful the second the special effects they are the closest ever seen real pyroclastic eruption but when elements which don speak are going the best parts your movie you probably better rewrite the script

1 |text here film that unexpected scary and original that caught off guard and threw for loop okay isn quite original considering sequel the box office hit species but certainly smart most films this genre are reminiscent those cheesy horror films from the 50s and 60s and some even become them however learned with the 1995 small budget horror sci film sometimes expectations can shattered lot criticism has gone against this film from what have read far anyway yep all two reviews and makes wonder why these types films are automatically dismissed gory laughable pieces trash but the thing isn well made well acted and quite intelligent can see most the critics now complaining about the level gore the level sexuality the film but the species series isn about the lack these elements about how much can get into one film and yet behind all has this basic premise that allows get away with doing species begins the present day though seems alternate universe many films especially sci ones create similar timelines our realistic one but change fit the film needs species begins with the arrival american spacecraft the excursion landing the surface mars aboard patrick ross justin lazard very bright and very handsome astronaut patrick the son senator ross james cromwell who just wants patrick succeed well would seem that has succeeded landing the surface mars the first human being ever course isn the first ever about billion years ago alien species supposedly landed mars and destroyed the perfect living conditions that were able sustain life now course the red planet cold and rocky life lives that visible life patrick upon leaving the spacecraft and landing the red soil collects samples from the ground takes them aboard and puts them storage unfortunately one the samples contains form life and gets loose when heated aboard the ship just prior heading back earth this life form creeps along the floor and inhabits the earthlings they pass out for approximately seven minutes and then shrug off nothing because they can even remember they blame technical malfunction back earth patrick begins have strong urges mate with many women possible know from the original this because the alien wants breed and take over the planet however the children that are bred are half human their father patrick really looking for another alien breed with and finds eve natasha henstridge eve was cloned from dna taken from sil the original alien however this time around most her alien urges have been either decreased dramatically lie dormant the project led laura baker marg helgenberger reprising her role from species and her motives seem respectable since she was involved with the original alien attack she wants learn how stop the alien should come again and has story wise species much stronger than its predecessor but also much stronger than say aliens hey love the film but you can tell was strong story what surprised the most with this film was the incorporation historical facts into the screenplay search for extraterrestrial intelligence course college learned about piece rock from mars which landed one the poles this piece rock contained fossils which may have been proof life mars later was proven that was not living creature that created the script uses this effectively but also manages provide well balanced plot beginning with the first man mars something have always dreamed seeing was hoping that the film would turn this element into useful starting point for the movie and does quite well the characters are all smart and they know what and what not the only character that seems little cliched the general george dzundza and yet remains logical everything does there are the obvious flaws course mostly lying the technical aspects the special effects are only mediocre and some are just plain bad but for the most part they remain believable even noticed homage the alien series when the mothers gave birth alien children also the most realistic ones are usually the goriest ranging from people being torn open someone head being blown off however some plot elements also may elicit laughs from the audience including menage troi that all but necessary many people dislike the species series because all excuse for sex nudity and gory violence however tend disagree what were the alien films about and alien species ever did come earth and their sole purpose was destroy wouldn you mate quickly possible with many people possible only gripe with this during the scene where patrick goes searching for mate grocery store didn realize that aliens were that picky choosing women mate with just assume his part human side looking for the most beautiful one the acting quite good for this kind film vast improvement over the first film least the acting the key element this film was bad would have lowered itself into camp was good would have asked for comparison with films like aliens okay isn that good george dzundza probably the most obvious mistake casting his over the top impersonation general makes him annoying and distracting natasha henstridge limited this time around she usually enclosed cage however she does manage very impressive performance with this aspect hindering any her talent yeah and she quite fun just plain watch marg helgenberger immensely better this time around and her performance probably the best this film michael madsen but isn annoying and soon becomes rather appealing with his nice cynic personality james cromwell has small part but makes much better than what could have been with more incapable actor say any film with james cromwell dramatically increases likeability mykelti williamson gives enjoyable performance and gives the film more down earth feel and course justin lazard lazard has far been ridiculed for his performance but think effective sure wooden but isn that what his character like the moment when touches the glass separating henstridge from him was extremely well done due the couple acting species rated for strong sexuality sci violence gore and language this definitely rated film that young kids should not see more than likely they would probably have nightmares and never have sex for the rest their lives hell don even know will what sure critically lambasted film turns out the surprise film the year probably won see another film where was expecting little and got much for quite while director peter medak has crafted very suspenseful and sometimes very scary movie out mediocre series medak has also mastered the wonderful jump moments and has probably the second scariest moment have ever seen film scream still has the first strong acting smart dialogue intelligent plotting and sure handed director species exactly what these films should entertaining
1 |text glory starring matthew broderick denzel washington and morgan freeman the true story the 54th regiment massachusetts the first black fighting unit recruited the north during the civil war broderick plays robert gould shaw the young white officer who led the black soldiers into battle shaw the son well abolitionists hailed from boston high society the letters wrote home his parents during the war are display harvard and were evidently the inspiration for glory the film begins 1862 shaw captain the northern forces like private eriksson michael fox casualties war shaw initially naive and idealistic about the war that until his company attacked enemy forces shaw experiences first hand the horror and chaos battle witnessing mass slaughter and receiving minor wound himself when bullet grazes his neck soon after his recovery shaw promoted colonel and assigned enlist and train blacks the war effort glory the story not only colonel shaw but also the black soldiers who laid down their lives free their brothers from slavery the film periodically jumps between shaw point view and the perspective the black soldiers the movie introduces handful black recruits and follow them from their enlistment through basic training and finally into action the large black cast uniformly outstanding especially washington who electrifying runaway slave with big mouth brash and pushy always getting into trouble and always looking for fight his bitter tough guy facade really just mask for his loneliness and vulnerability washington provides much the film intensity and emotional power one heartbreaking scene whipped for allegedly deserting the army when removes his shirt receive the punishment you cringe the sight his back which riddled with ugly scars from his days slave makes your blood boil the humiliation the beating far more traumatic than the actual physical pain brings tear rolls down washington cheek and will probably run down your cheek well the episode becomes even more tragic when learn that washington wasn deserting the army all left camp look for shoes because his feet were covered with oozing sores freeman usual strong presence even small supporting role plays grave digger who has buried more white soldiers than cares remember quickly becomes leader among the black soldiers holding the group together and serving liaison the white officers colonel shaw recognizes freeman leadership ability and promotes him sergeant major making him the first black officer the army andre braugher makes impressive film debut the role thomas searles free black who one shaw close childhood friends searles educated and refined like white man prompting washington nickname him snow flake the burning question whether searles tough enough survive basic training and kill combat the road from marching drills battle action bumpy one for the black regiment the soldiers suffer innumerable hardships but somehow they never lose their morale the army treats the black soldiers like second class citizens subjecting them racism and discrimination they are paid only month whereas their white counterparts earn thirteen and for long time they have without shoes guns uniforms make matters worse the white military hierarchy extremely reluctant allow the blacks into action preferring instead use them for manual labor eventually however the regiment receives its boots uniforms rifles and right fight thanks the stubborn resolve colonel shaw shaw has absolute faith his soldiers and fights tooth and nail get them what they deserve even means threatening general with blackmail broderick fact most convincing the scenes where shaw stands for the regiment unfortunately however broderick uneven performance many respects the weak link the movie effort look more mature broderick sports mustache and goatee and throughout the film slips and out phony boston accent never altogether convincing shaw since much the time his emotions seem forced the film places too much weight broderick character and not enough the black soldiers who are more intriguing glory regains lost ground with its harrowing depiction war the movie shows the devastation war without resorting the unnecessarily graphic gore which marred born the fourth july glory does not try rattle you with nauseating blood and guts except for few bullet wounds and one exploding head the film for the most part leaves the gore your imagination which not say that the battle scenes glory are timid the contrary they are chaotic and horrifying just that director edward zwick the creator thirtysomething films them with far more subtlety and restraint than oliver stone could ever muster the key glory the group dynamic among the black soldiers the movie depicts some but not enough their customs and rituals one scene for example the soldiers motivate themselves singing prayers around the campfire each man has chance relay few words inspiration couple the movie most touching moments involve young black children looking the black soldiers with awe disbelief and pride the regiment greatest triumph comes when the soldiers distinguish themselves battle thereby earning the respect their white peers and earning the honor leading the climactic assault fort wagner like any war film glory has its share gloom and despair but ultimately proves truly uplifting experience and important history lesson valuable reminder that despite what the history books say more precisely what they not say blacks played critically important role the north victory over the south forever changing the evolution america

-1 |text when the haunting arrived theaters all kept hearing about was the overdone special effects and the fact that very often the unseen bumps the night horror film are far scarier than those that you can put face courtesy special effects while agree that this remake the haunting goes bit overboard the visual effects department don think that they are completely blame for this movie failure appears that some people have failed take into account that the original haunting had the unseen terrors and was about scary dust bunny special effects not the story isn the least bit scary you aren going end with very frightening movie the thing that interested most about this movie was the caretaker this building played bruce dern dern always great and even though may have had only about minutes screen time was still the most interesting element the movie sat through the seemingly endless albeit fairly impressive special effects kept wishing that this movie was about dern caretaker and not the one dimensional characters that populated the cast never good sign when bit player the best part the movie liam neeson plays scientist who conducting experiments fear decides the best way get results trick group fairly unstable individuals spend few days haunted mansion tricks them into participating letting that conducting experiment insomnia and also fails mention that the mansion has reputation for strange goings catherine zeta jones lili taylor and owen wilson play his subjects like the original taylor character the star the movie but since she doesn quite have the marquee power liam neeson and zeta jones their parts did seem big larger than the original and let face probably half the people who see this movie will because zeta jones admit that would have never seen this thing she weren but the real stars here the special effects combined with the fairly overdone sets they take over the movie the supernatural elements the house start interact with our hapless insomnia patients there really isn much story here just endless setups director jan bont can showcase all the nifty special effects that got play with and the special effects are great many cases they are good you are likely see anywhere other cases they are overdone and obviously thrown just for the sake hitting the cool shots quota point the movie any these things ever come close being scary funny maybe but not scary then have the set when first saw the house was very impressed with the very cool gothic look about but only took short tour the characters around the place see that the set designers obviously had much money burn the visual effects people did and decided take the idiotically overdone route this included flooded hallway with books stepping stones and mirrored circular room that revolves what part did these rooms play the story absolutely none they were just there take our minds off the fact that there was neither descent story nor single scare the entire movie then have the actors lili taylor has never been one favorites and when the fact that her character mousy and pathetic factored she comes around the average slightly below mark have idea why liam neeson took this role basically reminded the ringmaster out control circus his character was charge this farce but quickly got away from him have doubt that liam will want lock all prints this movie very secure vault along with all copies darkman zeta jones was cast because she too hot for words the fact that her character sexual just icing the cake all catherine has this movie look good fortunately that something she does very well while she does have fairly good size part obvious that her only purpose the movie was eye candy too bad someone her talents wasted them here any random supermodel pulled out fashion show could have easily filled her role the haunting the antithesis another 1999 horror movies the blair witch project the haunting had seemingly limitless effects budget while blair witch relies piles rocks for its scares both prove quite nicely that special effects are irrelevant horror film the story sucks all downhill from there advice you are looking for special effects rent star wars scares you want rent halloween either way probably your best interests skip the haunting

problem the first place together they attempt find and destroy the surprisingly elusive godzilla with the resources the most cutting edge special effects houses and the clout one the nation premiere movie production companies one would think emmerich could make film truly deserving the name godzilla didn right there with the lost world godzilla one the biggest disappointments recent cinematic history the plot pretty much what expect the big dinosaur like creature comes out the water and starts smashing new york city and our heroes figure out why this thing its rampage and how can stopped while the military makes futile attempts bring the creature down the script however painfully bad fraught with lines corny they don even belong movies and includes many character actions which make

brushing against them but conveniently able leap atop others why helicopters have follow godzilla flying dangerously between buildings where they can lose sight him when they could more easily keep track him flying little higher and straight line why sidewinder missiles which have small explosive warheads blow entire buildings when they miss godzilla why mission bomb madison square garden carried out three fighter bombers when flights such aircraft are always comprised multiples two okay maybe the last one was bit nit picky but hey was roll broderick usually good actor but this film weighed down unexciting character and atrocious screenplay which seem fight against him every step the way hank azaria does what can but don expect see development any the promise showed the birdcage like broderick azaria character quite simply lacking color what really annoyed was maria pitillo who actually takes the bad script and makes worse with her acting casting must have been asleep this one the one bright spot here jean reno who oddly enough seems fit well into role which often comedic quite unlike what seem him the past although his character contradictory the unfolding disaster reno brings style the role phillipe which makes him enjoyable unfortunately the same cannot said the other incongruities the entire feel the movie tongue cheek and seems pay comical homage dozen films that have come before this results significant amount parody which contrasts sharply with the threat the monster and ends just producing mess most the characters seem there for comic relief and almost none are smart enough for the audience take seriously although emmerich obviously wanted make fun action picture what good sink millions into cgi creature whose ferocity undermined the humans threatens can take the characters seriously the threat they face empty one because simply don care what happens them godzilla simply pulls too many punches its attempt film more light hearted than should far from want see more carnage the theaters but here behemoth running through the city there bound lot casualties but instead godzilla afflicted with the after school joe cartoon syndrome where almost everyone seems get out harm way just time couple scenes godzilla briefly breathes fire none the characters even remark upon this ability nor used any particular advantage the filmmakers the special effects people just wanted show that yes godzilla can this just like the old movie consider another punch pulled through creative script writing you can make sequel out just about any movie but the final scene this one doesn just leave the door open opens into hallway leading directly into room where godzilla waiting patiently made want gag emmerich should have done away with the humor and jokes and played this one straight action film with intelligently written screenplay godzilla could have been much more however confusing the viewer with ton add ins and parodies the movie ends being something that just doesn work now they only had raymond burr

1 |text seen may 1999 home video rented one the best things about the movies that they can make you really start wonder and analyze things your own everyday life that you might not have thought much otherwise with some films might just secondary issue but with dark city what get nearly entire film committed philosophizing and theorizing about human memory and how defines who are which poignant theme made through absolutely beautifully constructed film with the kind story and setting that could only happen movie there old role playing computer game called wherein the player takes the role man who can remember who where and how got there the goal gather many clues possible figure that out and along the way overcome conflict the premise this film not unlike that game only this time don have control over the protagonist begin meeting seemingly ordinary man living extremely dark and dirty city actually more than just the city the whole reality that isn just that neo gothic look batman blade runner but fully developed almost different genre completely later will learn that his name john murdoch sewell but for now has idea what going other than the fact something not right the fact there dead body the corner goes enhance the feeling paranoia and mysterious hurried call telling him leave immediately also very chilling this opening scene alone goes long way define the setting the film and its bizarre horrific tone the man doesn know who nor where going and interesting follow him since the viewers have idea either can sympathize and identify with him fact this the way all stories begin since impossible know the history character their feelings values morals etc until after observed them for while but this case the total feeling amnesia excellent tool towards characterization developing the mood and outlining the story eventually some semblance plot begins unfold appears that john serial killer wanted the police met inspector frank bumstead hurt quiet unemotional soft spoken deadpan man who appears have been the trail the killer for some time two other important characters are also introduced daniel schreber sutherland neurotic psychiatrist who claims john doctor and emma murdoch connelly jazz singer dolled look like caraciture right out the old dick tracy serials any given leading lady the old film noir movies was schreber who contacted john for reasons that are continually revealed throughout the course the film also contacts emma which further helps the film reveal what seemingly complex mysterious back story but absolutely nothing appears dark city which what makes fascinating throughout its continual scenes confusion and vertigo everything the filmmakers want see has some significance considering how intricate the detail every single shot its lighting art direction and overall production design they don seem able afford any gratuities however that might also what keeping from reaching its maximum potential continuing follow john wanders around this strange place much unlike the real world know come realize that all hoax everyone the city the subject experiment being conducted race aliens understand what makes humans tick their efforts somehow save themselves from extinction but the film tagline says last night one went off for reasons that are never clearly explained appears that john possesses telekinetic powers can pretty much whatever his mind can conceive process known tuning the aliens which look like very old bald human men with pasty skin also possess the power masse and use change the city every night midnight the same time all the humans fall asleep and after the changes are made they awake and either continue where they left off begin new life they have idea they did not have until then this premise certainly interesting and director and screenwriter alex proyas able keep the film consistently mysterious this regard does provide some explanations such that schreber assistant the strangers because somehow could synthesize memory into chemical form the aliens mix and match the memories the city population see who will change and who will not the process this creates for good deal deep thought provoking philosophies that could applied the real world however where the film errs not playing the idea memory versus the human heart what makes person who she the main characters are all closely intertwined within the seemingly complex murder mystery which never actually happened yet when they start through some the expected emotions comes off distant static and cold mediocre performances hurt and connelly don help either for example john realizes emma not and probably never was his wife does not feel emotional bond her yet some scenes crucial the film plot are expected believe they have genuine love for each other which also part the film climax and ending and that what proyas seems inferring with the film but never quite manages convey its fullest sense ironically this what made his first film the crow work well which had similar theme struggling find hope and the human spirit within nearly identical dark twisted world with dark city the messenger seems mistaken for the message still the film means bad and consistently entertaining and enjoyable there lot like here most notably the sheer visual look and style all which accounts for least half the reasons the film able tell the story does the story whole one the most original come out hollywood years dark city what the movies are all about the escape from the real world

1 |text some friends who went live usa complain about one thing that country very different from the one depicted hollywood movies that especially true for those who end somewhere that unexplored land between los angeles and new york where they find their big surprise that the majority people vote republican church every sunday and usually don tolerate liberal attitudes that are taken for granted average american film such rude awakening however can happen another direction conservative people are sometimes forced discover unpleasant truths about world they live something like that happens jake van dorn george scott successful grand rapids businessman who shares strong calvinist convictions with the rest his community one day his daughter kristen ilah davis disappears from calvinist youth convention california van dorn worried because doesn believe that his daughter would run from home however the truth delivered private investigator andy mast peter boyle even harder kristen spotted cheap pornographic film infuriated van dorn unsatisfied with the way mast investigation going goes los angeles search for kristen himself unfortunately lacks experience and the quest that brought him the utter depths sex underworld fruitless things change when devises cunning plan and while doing stumbles sympathetic prostitute and part time porno actress nicky season hubley almost two decades after its release hardcore mostly forgotten critics and film scholars real shame because very few movies today hollywood would dare tackle controversial issues that writer and director paul schrader explored his second directorial attempt late 1970s was totally different situation films were expected have mature serious themes for the mature audience for schrader this film was nice opportunity expand the subplot his previous work taxi driver one that deals with the great generational divide that tormented the american society 1970s one side have old america that sticks the puritan ideals hard work and strict morals that made that country great but that america obviously unable cope with the new challenges brought the social turmoil 1960s and instead facing them prefers live rural conservative cocoons the new america the other hand fares better ideals the called sexual revolution same all other revolutions the swinging sixties degraded into exploitation and depravity instead being liberated baby boomers are stuck with their own inability cope with the newly discovered freedoms schrader very cleverly brings the idea that those two americas actually aren far away nice example brilliant scene which van dorn already described authoritarian and paternalistic capitalist meets sleazy porno producer the latter one also turns out authoritarian paternalistic and very dedicated this job the difference between the two simply the line work many contemporary critics actually accused schrader promoting conservative agenda the surface may look that way audience forced sympathise with van dorn and his quest the first scenes portrayed nice family man who actually doesn deserve experience parent worst nightmare the scene the porno cinema that reveals kristen fate extremely cruel pain and humiliation brought oscar winning actor george scott such intensity that the audience feels sorry for him and simply must support his agenda van dorn perhaps flawed and the subtle hints lead the unflattering truth the end but the viewers simply know that his cause just and that prodigal daughter must better off with her loving father than with the sleazy pornographers that only want exploit her body the other hand schrader who grew environment very much like van dorn his own parents wouldn allow him watch movies until was knows better and tries bring another side coin even the people connected with sex underworld can show redeeming qualities like nicky who actually tries improve her life and sleazy detective who develops something like conscience the end unfortunately schrader fails erase the impact the shocking scene the beginning and his attempt reconcile the opposing sides america seems lost somewhat clich finale the script slightly flawed and schrader director doesn show too much originality his style seems too influenced techniques that scorsese used taxi driver apart from the scenes grand rapids those two films even look alike but the content might more than interesting for today viewer especially those inspired the current 70s revival until boogie nights hollywood mainstream movie ever dared explore the phenomenon pornography 1970s hardcore the other hand might serve precious document because depicts sex film industry the period often regarded the golden age connoisseurs before the advent video when many the porno filmmakers could afford think themselves artists the view such age and the industry very unflattering though but for the film whose main character takes time explain calvinist doctrines the audience that shouldn too surprising anyway despite some flaws hardcore remains very interesting and powerful piece cinema

1 |text been good long while since had good old fashioned thriller where mostly everything goes right for the audience and wrong for the characters but been even longer since saw thriller that actually shock cared for the characters not merely judged them but actually allowed their human foibles flaws and strengths emerge radiantly saw that been least couple decades even far back the great hitchcock thrillers though hardly comparing simple plan say rear window strangers train yet almost good simple yet strangely complex and astonishingly rewarding because instead moving from plot point plot point and merely laying out they might caught overtones instead concerns itself with the moral corruption and depths greed that its protagonists can all without ever judging them either evil even immoral elegantly directed sam raimi yes the same simple plan concerns itself with the discovery crashed plane and within bag full millions dollars upright moderately financially stable working man bill paxton his dim witted brother billy bob thornton and his drinking buddy brent briscoe without anyone around and the possibility that one would come looking for the three debate and debate but finally reach the decision that yes they will keep but until any authorities possible owners the cash come looking and they generally don flaunt anything they don want flaunt they keep stored away the custody paxton the possibilites this circumstance are much diverse they could endlessly play cat and mouse with the authorities they could try fight off the rightful owners who are either villainous just they could fight amongst themselves simple plan though borrows little from each these little tiff with the cops here subplot involving alleged fbi agent chilling gary cole there and bit inside feuding over here but austin powers would say that not necessarily its bag baby what most admired about this film and what makes this far superior and unique thriller that successfully able have its cake and eat too effectively involves some the traditional thriller cliches like the ones mentioned above but the same time involves itself more deeply with the way the characters become morally corrupt and what price they have pay have what they think happiness black duffle bag while steps are taken neatly cover things and these subsequent steps miserably awry the film choses never loose the sight that covering things the extent that these characters have they are slowly losing their souls and their humanity one early scene paxton and thornton have make trip back the plane return some the money doesn look like was all stolen not bad idea when thornton screws does continuously throughout the movie and paxton has some major covering read homicide instead quick murder and immeadiate hands washing raimi shows lengthy painful shot from low angle onto paxton face tries sift through his emotions and reach conclusion there similar shot afterwards paxton watching the murder committing and taking all the horror which also wonderfully effective but the previous shot even better more morally complex and more gut wrenching short probably the best piece direction raimi ever done demonstrating once again that sometimes the simplest way something yields the best results for further proof watch persona sex scene and witness what may the best scene ingmar bergman ever done but the film hardly stops here follows completely through and rarely loses sight its characters humanity and the depletion thereof yet also moves from step step such graceful method that never feel like the film merely stamping out the plot points the story when the time comes for paxton start becoming selfish and thus diabolical with aid from his pregnant wife played bridget fonda pal raimi does and soon the horror the situation escalating tragic heights there least two grand shootouts and least one them may one the greatest shootouts cinema history and when they arrive they don come with masochistic delight but with cringe inducing horror during the one was actually sinking into chair with the mantra they can this can they streeming through head fact this film which getting many comparisons the coen superior but forget about fargo has many similar moments manic insanity attributed the major amount subtlety and restraint with which the directors direct what other hands would over the top distractedness imagine suppose robert rodriguez directing this then again after seeing the evil dead films hardly assume raimi would able pull something like this off although there are moments the film which are easily dubbed raimi moments rifle shot notwithstanding instead raimi directs with maturity and gentle touch easily letting the story and characters exist while still letting some the more traditional raimi elements come out like some offbeat comic touches most particularly billy bob thornton character jacob brilliant creation his dim wittedness often hilarious for most the film every line uttered was greeted with howling laughter but there authenticity the performance that strangely enough makes sure that not totally laughing him the chuckles gets are not necessarily ones full condescension because thornton damn real jacob multi dimensional character and while being stupid see that not much flaw but strength his character his simplicity endearing and many the acts commits are out strong inner strength and belief system primarily towards the middle where his bud and conspirator begins make some heavy waves concerning the money the final third the film spends much time with him and many the touches upon his character not only thornton but also screenwriter scott smith adapting his own book the way are just great particularly admired back story about old high school girlfriend told thornton with such sincerity and acception that the cruel story reversed near sweetness and further strength his saddened character thornton absolutely brilliant this performance far the best performance ever given and further proof that the best character actor contemporary cinema you don believe back and watch his wonderful performance primary colors performance that would have been nominated for oscar this hadn been the same year because easily able slip into character and make him completely and utterly believable brings much weight the film that with most character actors difficult picturing anyone else the role the rest the cast great too from paxton declining working man chelcie ross amiable town sheriff even fonda shows off her talents nicely and had any complaints about the film that the plot almost too simplistic and that times seems too much like exercise like cruel test humanity that still pays attention the humanity involved and the occasional narration usually annoying narration should used with extreme caution especially when you trying set things and express emotions didn raimi watch the first murder scene and the thing that can most usually wrong with movie the ending basically amiss won reveal but way too cruel and too much outsider set the appearance plane wasn already too much that anyway for film that deals much and intimately with the humanity the characters involved this the wrong ending imagine character controlled ending otherwise like crime and punishment the police had caught him instead him breaking down and confessing not that all comparing simple plan dostoevsky the ending does work despite protestations but there was something incessantly nagging and unsatisfying about but you had qualms and were happy clam with then just ignore and about your day but despite mere claims make mistake that was completely and utterly edge seat throughout and even sometimes curdling the situations that occured not because any kind gore factor which thankfully for this very minimal but because the film places its characters situations and gives them such painful things overcome that frankly not seen much like quite awhile least not since the previous worthy hitchcockian masterpiece

1 |text true faith and its expression through organized religion difficult subject for motion picture tackle head which probably why few them even the most religious directors like martin scorsese ingmar bergman usually address issues faith implicit rather than explicit religious terms not hard see why took robert duvall fifteen years get the apostle onto the big screen matter fact even after fifteen years still never managed get financial backing and ended paying for with million his own money also wrote the script directed the film and starred the central character fiery texas preacher named euliss sonny dewey few filmmakers have the courage and sheer audacity take that kind financial technical and creative responsibility single handedly and testament what intensely personal project this was for duvall and thankfully every bit that personal investment translates screen into power and honest emotion sonny energetic pentecostal preacher who has been speaking actually shouting from behind the pulpit since was twelve spends much his time traveling about the country evangelizing with other preachers tent revivals unlike most hollywood characterizations intense preachers sonny not phony swindler and the film purpose not unearth hypocrisy and sin either sonny the church duvall makes abundantly clear that sonny truly believes what says although like all humans has weaknesses one his weaknesses become apparent when finds out that not only does his long suffering wife jessie farrah fawcett want leave him for another man the congregation but the two them have secretly plotted remove him preacher faced with the loss two things loves passionately his church and his family that same raw power that allows sonny get entire congregations rocking and swaying transforms into violent temper his son baseball game sonny snaps and smashes his wife lover the face with baseball bat inflicting wound that may fatal not knowing what else sonny disappears throws away his identification drives his car into lake and takes bus louisiana hoping start over again the tiny mostly poor coastal town bayou boutte sonny once again finds his calling after befriending simple auto mechanic walt goggins and tracking down the town minister john beasley sonny sets his own church the one way heaven temple christening himself the apostle quickly draws together eager congregation and together they realize real change each other lives but always sonny past lurking step behind him waiting swallow his progress duvall has made his intentions making the apostle clear recent article newsweek wrote filmmakers hardly ever depict spirituality with such strong emphasis the holy spirit and when they tends patronizing full charlatans and snake handlers but what really wanted was try understand what these preachers through and what they believe and portray accurate way the strength duvall convictions turn out the strength his film the apostle always rings true even the most painful moments because know being sincere with the subject matter after fifteen years traveling the country listening all shapes and sizes ministers and taking studious notes what they said duvall has captured the energy and vitality what means truly spiritual his sonny man who speaks directly god and expects spoken right back always called you jesus and you always called sonny says when neighbors call and complain that being too loud one night one his rants with the man upstairs sonny mother june carter cash just hangs them because she knows there sense trying interrupt him the main theme emerge from the apostle the fact that good can come from any situation sonny act violence toward another human being inarguably horrific thing and duvall never shrinks from that fact however that very same act violence what brings sonny bayou boutte where finds people whom desperately needs and who desperately need him his short time louisiana does world good and when the police finally show take him away goes quietly knowing that deserves the punishment that awaiting him and scene during the final credits shows even turns his punishment into positive opportunity for change and betterment that strength sonny character that makes him appealing and magnetic others flawed but powerful enough overcome those flaws weak men are the ones who simply accept their weaknesses and lack the desire better themselves watching duvall screen not hard imagine that would have been magnificent preacher had chosen that vocation over acting sonny completely inhabits the character and his performance certainly the best the year because spent much time absorbing the traits methods quirks and personalities real preachers duvall was able create complete character who always feels indelibly human director duvall feels that less more his camera simply takes what goes front with very little intrusion there are fancy crane shots extended dollies excessive close ups duvall knew that the power the film characters enhanced the fact that cast mostly non professional churchgoers and actual ministers didn need artificially enhanced this way the apostle almost plays out like documentary not only its technical simplicity but more importantly its sense reality

1 |text playwright tom stoppard and screenwriter marc norman took astonishingly difficult task they wanted write script about william shakespeare that parallels shakespeare works they also wanted poke fun the way all envision shakespeare mean really who doesn think shakespeare guy seething with much passion that can barely write play without exploding into passionate introspective verbal couplet iambic pentameter stoppard and norman are men who love shakespeare and they wanted make movie for everyone else who loves shakespeare and despite the difficulty their task they have succeeded shakespeare love one the smartest funniest most touching films the year rare that picture with such high aspirations succeeds all its endeavors but here have movie that defines success once charmingly acted and flawlessly written could have been smug self important movie that panders die hard shakespeare fans but the appeal this film almost universal you ever read play shakespeare know anything about his life likely that you find grand entertainment shakespeare love joseph fiennes brother ralph stars shakespeare himself delightful irresistible lad concerned mostly with women and detached from life more serious problems debt plague etc commissioned write plays for various people queen elizabeth judi dench wants comedies while local slimeball philip henslowe geoffrey rush needs him write play that can pay off his debts hugh fennymann tom wilkinson shakespeare however has trouble focusing his work begins work comedy about boy named romeo and girl named ethel this all changes however when meets viola lesseps radiant gwyneth paltrow young heiress set marry the financially oriented lord wessex colin firth shakespeare instantly falls love with her first meets her when she pretends man try out for the part romeo discovers her identity and confronts her later she course falls love with him although their love doomed because she absolutely must marry the tyrannical lord wessex but she continues act because she loves shakespeare writing much and soon the production which later becomes romeo and juliet set performed shakespeare love amazingly good film not because works great entertainment but because pays attention detail and knows its subject matter was instantly won over joseph fiennes the lead role has such searing optimism and energy clearly man who admires shakespeare and even the shortcomings that gives his character inability turn away from women attention deficit disorder sense great deal affection and care practically overflows with passion every scene fiennes matched paltrow whose english accent good that wonder where she actually comes from she actress who exudes strength and conviction every performance seen her the two performers work perfectly together taking the passionate scenes far possible without making them melodramatic and wringing the comedic scenes for every conceivable laugh course doesn hurt that they have masterful script work with stoppard whose play rozencrantz and guildenstern are dead inspired interesting film full dry wit and boundless understated humor all his plays have similarly dry humor the first intelligent step stoppard and norman took was harmonizing the events the film with romeo and juliet one the funniest scenes the film imitation the famous terrace scene from the play the movie shakespeare bumbling about while viola trying fend off her nurse maid director john madden does fantastic job dabbling slapstick humor scenes like these would have seemed obtuse the hands lesser director going have see the movie again certain there are numerous references that missed fact doubt possible gather everything with just one viewing stoppard master detail you notice familiar lines placed throughout the film not lines play but dialogue suggesting that shakespeare simply spoke like that all the time there also brilliant running joke which shakespeare constant competition with christopher marlowe and the fact that marlowe played the openly homosexual rupert everett joke itself proposing slightly twisted explanation marlowe mysterious death pub there also scene featuring wide eyed dog that funny that hurt myself laughing there dog this play dog the ensemble cast perhaps the strongest this year geoffrey rush nearly unrecognizable the detestable henslowe wilkinson also hard recognize but has great role thug who takes his part the apothecary seriously ben affleck playing one the actors the company shows great range both his accent his almost good paltrow and humor has some the best one liners the movie colin firth always stuck playing the sap does good job being hateful judi dench however has the best supporting performance queen elizabeth rarely has much depth been conveyed few words single minor complaint about shakespeare love that feel like could have been more moved the end the story moving but there are few missed opportunities the final scenes but quibbling not important what important that acknowledge the quality this picture the sheer skill with which has been written acted and produced shakespeare love tries many things and nails every one them film that both loves shakespeare and makes fun him film which the actors writers and director are all perfectly sync also movie that has the potential introduce lot people shakespeare work positive way without seeming condescending superior admire this film not only because passes pleasantly but because has lofty aspirations and succeeds them not just any film can poke fun shakespeare and get away with

the rise labors however has come new menace labor crime this led the creation the two special vehicle divisions using patrol labors fight labor crime the patlabor story centers around the second

uses this setting make its central point progress moving too fast for humans keep are history and culture falling the wayside like the old buildings that are being torn down and replaced with new this question just applicable today patlabor alternate 1999 setting far the technical aspects the film referring the subtitled version that the only one seen the film transfer clear almost phenomenally the animation quality incredible though the character design different from what most patlabor fans will used the oavs and series were more cheerful better suited humor the movie however makes everyone

ever seeing fish eye perspective used any other animated film save for _ghost the shell_ another oshii film indeed many other movies all the cinematography well suited the storyline emphasizing what needs though couple scenes where characters features are exaggerated anger may seem slightly strange western audiences the audio track _patlabor the movie_ glorious stereo and should used demonstrate home theater systems _is_ that good even without headphones sounds from either side the screen can clearly heard _come_ from that side giant robot footsteps are deep and booming the sometimes understated sometimes blaring score crisp and clear and always right the mark enhancing the moods created the animated scenery far the subtitles have say that they among the most easily readable subtitles ever seen for _anything_ large enough that they don strain the eyes but small enough not conceal too much the screen although does have several action sequences most notably the climactic conclusion _patlabor_ foremost not action movie although superbly realized film relies large part upon prior familiarity with some the characters carry the story and that could detract from some

1 |text seen september 1998 the sony nickelodeon theaters boston theater with matt perreault for free using sony loews critic pass theater rating okay seats sound and picture modern society now inundated with more sex and sexuality than ever has been before from teenage sitcoms rated films about fetishes the biggest debate the subject whether not affects reality just reflects your friends and neighbors takes different approach film that revolves almost entirely around sex and how can used for both pain and pleasure even within small circle friends one the most important aspects the film that most noted and analyzed before the film can really dissected whole writer director neil labute basic setup and some the unique methods employs tell the story firstly and most importantly the fact the script tells rather complex detailed story lust betrayal arrogance hypocrisy greed and just plain stupidity between six different characters three men three women without hardly any supporting characters few have line two mostly extras everything they will somehow affect another character and ultimately come full circle back themselves whether positive negative but just state this arbitrary and explaining and criticizing the process difficult labute ability tell his story through few characters remarkable feat but what specifically impressive the fact the characters names are never revealed until the end credits roll for the sake this review will describe the characters and refer them their main characteristic another interesting accomplishment the fact every scene takes place inside with limited focus always able tell where the characters are someone home the gym restaurant hotel room etc but what the city they live what year what the society like etc relatively unknown the film complete character study with the tight intense drama the theater one plot dominates the story which makes the first act bit tedious for its lack background simply dropped the characters lives and are expected figure out the rest the characters are group middle class white people who are all successful what they but they only concern right now seems their sex lives first there barry eckhart and mary brenneman married couple who are going through dry spell not unlike many other couples other situations who don know what they problem barry kind dorky businessman who loves his wife and the sex they have but doesn have lot ambition just follows everyone else mary writer some sort but lacks aggression and emotion like her husband and the meekness character but ironically doesn hesitate commit adultery just feel something labute script does good job characterizing mary and barry individuals but very light chemistry and connection between the two obviously this the theme which enhanced the actors good performances but the same time seems just bit hollow another couple jerry stiller and terri keener who live together and seem have been involved with each other for long time yet they constantly argue over anything and everything their sex life also fraught with problems and for some reason they continue throughout their infidelitous relationship only one aspect the film could use improvement would this area natural for married couple become bored with each other but why would two people who can barely stand each other continue have sex and live together what did they ever see the other person begin with labute never really answers but since the film more concerned with the payoff than the process still makes for good drama tension and manip ulation intricate and deceitful fascinating two other characters act catalysts cary jason patric and cheri natassja kinski cary arrogant hostile sex maniac who defines the word bastard somehow able bend women his will either through charm just attitude into getting his way the kind guy everyone should stay away from realize secretly perverted but somehow barry finds comfort his company although jerry always nervous around him patric gives outstanding performance much that want know more about him despite how intimidating and unlikable cheri character labute uses catalyst see how the other characters react her she works art museum and some point throughout the film each character will engage her almost the exact same conversation and her reaction always different from becoming involved relationship with one brushing off small talk with another being outright appalled yet another she sweet woman perhaps the most normal any the characters and although her symbolism obvious her role the outsider the most relatable will not reveal who cheats who and how each character specifically affected the others action that the hook the film the first two acts begin set the characters and each scenarios but often difficult tell what they will about and with whom the result sometimes surprising other times predictable but the actual course actions always fascinating for while everyone has their fun but ultimately each character guilt attitude ignorance will disserve them one the most important things note how realistic the story supposed since the characters only interact with each other there isn much pop culture references almost everything has deeper philosophy behind are assume that these people are the title states our friends and neighbors don know anyone going through the same situations these people often times the film not unlike network melodrama other times situations are like those not seen outside porno movie but what this film does have that the others don repercussions the end although the film creates its own reality goes show that even the immoral aren immortal what way your friends and neighbors supposed work open interpretation definitely has lot say about the price that comes with infidelity but could have been even better had expanded that theme more specifically still accomplishment film making because has put timeless theme into modern perspective

-1 |text well here distasteful thoroughly amateurish item that surprisingly was actually box office hit the time its release after just viewing the film for the first time primary question how did anyone with north enjoy this movie cheap idiotic unfunny and not nearly raunchy had heard was least some smut would have livened things bit porky tells the story you can call that four clueless high school buddies pee wee dan monahan billy mark herrier tommy wyatt knight and mickey roger wilson whom desperately want get laid women for the most part are mystery them and this movie they are the audience well since all them are written and acted they are aliens from different planet their plan sidetracked however when they venture out smarmy strip bar named porky which they are able get into using fake after they pay the manager one hundred bucks for three hookers they are played trick and find themselves being dumped into the swamp below the building for these four teenage guys this means war porky porky ultimately manages fail almost every possible level teenage sex romp not wild amusing enough comedy all the jokes are predictable and fall flat look back the 1950 something suspect most people from that era would want bury deep grave and revenge movie crushing bore one the most offensive things about porky how jaw droppingly inaccurate the film about teenagers the four main characters are not even attempted developed characters and learn very little about them except that they are horny and would probably feel more comfortable preschool that sure revealing information the female characters fare even worse under the inaudacious screenplay and direction bob clark the women are all treated objects comedy props rather than real people for example the two gym teachers mrs balbricker nancy parsons and honeywell kim cattrall only have one purpose and that made fun mrs balbricker gruff holds barred overwight woman who will not stand for any foolishness and one particularly embarrassing scene for all involved honeywell has sex with coach and barks like dog there way tell parsons cattrall are servicable actresses even though have the suspicion they are not but one thing for sure they are asked things this film that are not all funny only humiliating prove how out touch this called comedy compare other more serious films about teenagers and looks even worse comaprison any the john hughes pictures such 1984 sixteen candles 1985 the breakfast club put porky even greater shame those films actually dealt with serious teen matters but remained great deal funnier thanks their bright and truthful writing and heck porky wanted teenage sex movie take 1982 fast times ridgemont high 1982 the last american virgin over this any day the week director bob clark not bad director two years after made porky directed the nostalgic holiday classic christmas story would forgive him for this misfire fact wasn for the fact that also wrote the screenplay just the thought that someone would actually sit down write such piece garbage and think that was actually film worth releasing unto the unsuspecting world actually whole lot funnier than anything porky

-1 |text paul verhoeven the dutch auteur who dragged his violent sexually aggressive aesthetic into american film has never been what consider thoughtful director though some his films notably starship troopers have been lauded artistic achievements but the kind hollywood film maker who managed matter what the budget make his films distinctive and even sometimes smuggle stimulating themes into the lavish high concepts which toils starship troopers was essentially monster movie remake his enthralling dutch war film soldier orange great film that nearly impossible find video yet showgirls everywhere which cast troop stunningly attractive mannequins the square jawed casper van dien and denise richards who may actually silicone what feels like american propaganda picture set monotonous scenes graphic carnage not completely successful film but failure certainly interesting and mostly entertaining one favorite verhoeven films were the ones made before hit our shores spetters dark near pornographic coming age film set within the sub culture drag racing and the aforementioned soldier orange haven yet gotten around seeing the 4th man turkish delight believe his best hollywood film robocop bleak super hero satire with robotic hero that touching schwarzenegger that movie was violent but not the overdone cartoonish manner more recent verhoeven pics its violence seemed there for purpose namely create atmosphere unpredictable dread not simply titillate attention deprived audience there jaw dropping scene within the first ten minutes robocop wherein the lead villain toys with cop before snuffing him tortures the officer taking glee his victim every fearful tic startling moment barbaric maddening violence that effectively sets the tone for the film that could designated splatter punk noir hollow man kevin bacon brutally slays dog because just won shut impales worker drowns another and but why his character introduced smug genius the kind who always impeccably dressed and races sports car while generic rock tunes blare from his stereo for the world hear sort like scheming uber villain from dallas melrose place though once the character becomes invisible this film has him pull 180 shift into psychotic movie monster the kind who just won die hollow man protagonists are the completely bland but beautiful scientist linda elizabeth shue acting she were rebecca sunnybrook farm and her lover hunk beef scientist played josh brolin who saddled with the film worst lines lost cohesion again they typical aaron spelling couple good looking but vacant george bush republican national convention speech bush referring clinton much promise but what end what end this actually got applause suddenly warren beatty doesn look absurd the rest the film characters are all well past thirty though act like annoying high school party animals insulting one and other with series strained one liners just have labored insults become big budget hollywood new character developing technique ahh what cynical time live the picture opens meet cain kevin bacon egocentric scientist working with the crew aforementioned irritating scientists top secret top secret the government has only provided them with dilapidated warehouse which perform their extensive experimentation project with the goal make invisibility possibility for what purpose never hinted they performed several experiments animals and have nearly solved the quandary causing caine twist worthy the film 1950 late show origins impulsively experiment himself caine neglects let the pentagon his plans and somehow gets two his workers lie for him the rest the crew will think the pentagon gave the ahead our mad scientist turned invisible after several heavy complications then inexplicably hinted that the process invisibility has made the animals into more savage creatures but this never explored and that was the case why the hell would anyone stupid enough test this out human begins raping assaulting and murdering anyone pleases always with lame wisecrack ready freddy krueger grows abundantly clear with each new release that verhoeven films that have become hollow like the rest this one cold heartless and full contempt for humanity but addition all that lacks any trace wit insight and makes statement other than audiences will pay for anything these days affront anyone looking for something stimulating intellectual level even those hoping spend saturday night with fun thrill minute ride verhoeven has instead served utterly routine mad slasher flick with nobody root for and reason care the previews make hollow man look like irresistible flick how can one not have good time film that utilizes state the art illustrate invisible man getting down and dirty with his bad self couple weeks ago after seeing the trailer bunch friends and got into long discussion how invisible man flicks never far have the invisible individual indulging their newfound ability hollow man looked like the first film and whoa serious manner boot but yeah directed paul verhoven not atom egoyan peter greenway verhoeven delivers the sleazy goods but not watchable thrillingly disturbing manner here just feels icky and uncomfortable the director keeps his camera trained his nubile actresses caressing their breasts with his lens all while faux psycho music strains the background plainly obvious that verhoeven isn exploring voyeurism like the classic peeping tom but exploiting and not even doing that very well funny that with all the technology million can get you verhoven stuck trying figure out how show woman naked breast manipulated invisible hand most vexing that the invisibility aspect used simply gimmick yet another slasher movie wherein characters stupid things just the villain can pop for more attacks fact largely irrelevant that bacon invisible since the end most his potential victims don infer red glasses that track his body heat every mad slasher film get the killers pov scene where spies his neighbor while she undresses triggered unpleasant memories slumber party massacre and lots scenes where people are unknowingly stalked the film only provides one moment that found genuinely creepy happens when lab assistant kim dickens who looks like she stepped out playboy the middle chit chat with invisible bacon suddenly pauses are you looking she queries obviously haunted little moment big film with nothing offer but ground breaking special effects set plot that should have run its course 1982 the apex the mad slasher craze those special effects are stunning they alone keep this from being bad urban legend still know what you did last summer and they the only reason check out hollow man preferably mid week bargain rental you been

1 |text note some may consider portions the following text spoilers forewarned east meets west mulan the latest installment disney parade annual animated feature films odd fusion ancient asian traditions and disconcerting elements which betray obvious mass market commercial sensibilities this confident entry easily the most engaging and satisfying hollywood animated feature years but falls short actualizing its potential though not for lack trying many respects mulan among disney most mature efforts skirting the surface adult themes and daring sneak glimpses into the messier side combat the violence the battles the film are admittedly sanitized the imagery pillaged village neatly encapsulated the form child discarded doll itself more harrowing than luke discovering his fallen guardians star wars and mulan later heroics dispatching the ruthless invaders done the most tidy bloodless method imaginable yet how often does hollywood animated film long considered the last safe refuge for the innocent dare touch upon the consequential horrors war such provocative manner instant idealistic mulan innocence lost and her jovial squadron are reminded what their efforts are spent defending the film based upon ancient chinese fable centers spirited young woman who disguises herself man order serve her family obligatory conscript when china finds itself under attack huns cartoonishly depicted easy demonic overtones replete with glowing yellow eyes and dagger edged teeth although lent surprisingly genuine sense menace dipping into the mythology other cultures for the first time after cavorting animated revisitings familiar western european fables and literature for decades disney new film boldly set ancient china rather than relocated elsewhere story intact some neutral territory and revels its east asian roots aside from predominantly asian american cast providing the film vocal work there liberal usage oriental iconography throughout and the artwork reveal hints japanese anime influence while the film does occasionally reach its limits and starts tread upon old stereotypes invoking pseudo asian references items like beancurd and rice every third sentence grows rather hoary and can imagine that the regiment for ancient chinese warriors really included karate chopping blocks stone two rather remarkable that movie primarily positioned for american and european audiences delves wholeheartedly into new foreign territory the film also freely touches upon cultural idiosyncrasies from its outset although savvy viewers should easily pick the intrinsics immediately startlingly assertive providing little shorthand does unfamiliar youngsters with regards the customs and traditions mulan land its core the film tale heroic adventure and such paints its story bold strokes honour perseverance nobility and courage such animation the perfect vehicle for this flavour epic where stark emotional simplicity able effectively work hand hand with visual purity scenes which would play out unbearably hokey live action such mulan venerable father pridefully tossing aside his cane when accepting his draft notice are lent sense strength and conveyed with greater emotional clarity animation mulan capitalizes this during its strongest moments particularly during our heroine character defining opening half hour when the film attempts integrate the traditional mainstays recent hollywood animation the friendly animal sidekick the colourful array supporting characters into the mix where goes slightly awry off battle mulan finds herself being trailed jive talking diminutive dragon called mushu and agreeable little lucky cricket who ostensibly appear assist her subterfuge and realistically serve audience friendly comic relief they affable presences and not precisely ineffective reasonable amounts humour are elicited and eddie murphy who voices mushu amusingly earnest but amidst all the high melodrama the effect mildly jarring and from storytelling perspective questionable its necessity training camp mulan antagonizes and eventually wins over trio fumbling recruits easily characterized simply the short clown the skinny clown and the big clown who provide more levity into the film with decidedly less effectiveness and familiar retread traditional disney patterns she grows certain fondness for handsome square jawed young captain shang everybody needs love even ancient chinese warrior princesses but not necessarily this film the romantic angle which lets the air out the sails the story neo feminist underpinnings lacks any genuine spark and plays out like contractual obligation another staple recent disney animated films cache hummable little ditties has also obligingly been carried over mulan

1 |text just have disney films gradually lost their appeal was almost stunned the quality who framed roger rabbit fun unique look world where cartoons and people lived together the little mermaid harkened back and perhaps surpassed the classic disney animations from the first half the century however the endless stream the little mermaid wanna getting you know the spiel lame plot recycled from some well known story colorful almost psychedelic animation the lead character who learns valuable moral lesson the comedic sidekick sidekicks the seemingly unattainable love interest few catchy songs few jokes for adults and the occasional out place warner brothers coyote fall off the cliff type joke formula and like any formula gets tiresome that why delighted hear that disney recently picked the international distribution rights the works ghibli japanese cartoon studio from what seen their movies kiki delivery service and the already english dubbed and american distributed neighbor totoro foreign audiences are for treat these movies particularly kiki delivery service are wonderfully original and entertaining kiki delivery service starts with unusual premise kiki upon hearing forecasts clear skies decides time for her leave home this unusual because kiki isn college student young adult making her start the world but thirteen year old girl eager begin her training witch her mother also witch and thirteen the obligatory age for such training her parents treat her leaving understandingly and put only token resistance just the idea witch heroine may scare away some audiences but mention made the occult and the subject dealt with harmlessly throughout the movie kiki mother acts village doctor and kiki able more than fly broom kiki must choose city move and what she chooses the star the movie german seaport town far removed from the country life she has been used initially lost the impersonal hugeness her surrounding she discouraged and unable support herself though her rudimentary skills witch the verge leaving for new town she uses her power flight deliver pacifier baby who dropped the favor eventually blossoms into her working courier one persons delivery service this where the movie becomes shockingly good kiki job catalyst for her realizing the beauty the city and the world around her the townspeople she put contact possess inner worth that doesn seem forced artificial but merely derived from looking ordinary people different light they three dimensional impossible quickly evaluate possessing faults and understandably reserving kindness towards strange girl however each one has something about them some interest trait that makes them interesting and unique the personal beauty the citizens complimented the beauty the surroundings the seaport town genuinely looks impressive capturing the european charm medieval city adapted the more modern needs the 1950 this beauty beauty with depth for every detail left dozens are only hinted could probably all day but won suffice say that many these minor details could have been the highlight the movie some favorites are kiki relationship with the baker husband although quiet never shown speaking kiki throughout the movie and initially scares her his kindness wins her friendship the garage deliveree house can found vintage model two old ladies have relationship evolving from master servant friend friend such details gives the impression that the beauty shown the movie only the tip the iceberg added top this lesson the importance self worth kiki initially seems derive much her self worth from the beauty her surroundings and the people around her but encounter with rude girl crashes down her bewonderment making her question the importance such beauty this causes kiki lose faith herself however kiki comes realize not only the beauty her surroundings but the innate beauty inside her seeing kiki regain faith herself marvelous and the principal device used sublime that don even want hint the ending the movie has subtle charm combined with sense awe and ironically the most disney esque moment ever seen you don hold your breath wonder you might want get medical attention the movie steers free many the disney conventions there violence however cartoonish song and dance number and kiki pet cat jiji more friend than comedic sidekick although jiji given many funny lines and scenes however would surprised disney doesn give jiji more jokes least the voice some comedian refreshingly enough the moral lesson the movie not self contradicted habit disney movies have gotten into beauty and the beast beautiful belle for instance learned that beauty was derived from person inside and was then rewarded having the beast turn into handsome prince snazzy clothing kiki the other hand learns separate her wardrobe from her self image and nothing more made her early desires for better clothing than illustrating her increased maturity the end the film another difference with disney movies the style animation for kiki delivery service not colorful and dynamic disney animation can but with greater attention realism and detail fits the movie this particularly true with scenes kiki flights the extreme realism the birds flight near kiki magnificent behold and helps these scenes capture the wonder flight better than any other film ever seen not sure when how this movie will released the united states disney tentatively plans theater release monoko hime shortly following the summer japanese release and should start releasing the other ghibli films after that guess that some will released video and some will theatrically released peak seasons with competing disney release although the wait unfortunate good know that being released all for kiki delivery service definitely movie worthy widespread promotion and release watch this movie along with man bites dog and perhaps something woody allen this the best movie ever seen

1 |text think the first thing this reviewer should mention wether not fan the files first let assure you that prior experience with the series required fully enjoy this movie the producers are not stupid making movie just for fans the series not profitable you have reach for larger audience therefore the movie quite user friendly altough non fans will only fail understand certain emotions behind the looks many characters exchange but fear not duchovny and another man later provide more than adequate background info what going you will never feel you just walked the third act some great opera any case the answer not fan the files only watch when nothing else and prefer millennium however since the fox network been kind air several key episodes for several weeks before the movie opening weekend took that opportunity test the movie taped all these episodes and watched them only after seing the movie glad report that learned nothing new everything you need know explained the viewer duchovny and others know going maybe bit too far make point but everybody should get the chance experience this movie warning major spoilers follow please not read fully enjoy this movie you must not able know what coming what exactly over that hill and what that weird hummm sound all about you have been warned the files what summer should exciting scary great special effects unlike other summer movies the effects not take over the movie and are only there when really necessary and good performances this coming from guy who thinks david duchovny the human equivalent wooden plank from start finish this movie does not let you when compare with last summer movies the best way describe would take the excitement and great score from face off and the deadly use sound from event horizon this flick scary not movie kind way where you always know where and when the critter will jump our heroes fact the first time the critter this movie makes apperance totally out the blue you might well bring ear plugs because this thing louuuudd the last time monster scared that much was when first saw aliens six year old kid you know when you are affraid put you feet the floor because the creature might under the chair when you keep trying cover your throat with your shirt yeah the files scary and guess what you never even have see the monster but your imagination works overtime and sure beats having watch flawed computer generated babyzilla looks like you could walk right through not even scarier than your grandma undies type monster not think that the files monster movie fact the creature there for maybe three minutes total the files definately mulder episode the series scully his side course but gillian anderson gets maybe half the screen time she has couple good scenes with duchovny but she gets kidnapped during the last half hour the movie she does not get much this mulder time the spotlight now you have heard the scene where mulder showers independence day you have not then will not spoil for you let just say that due recent events mulder should showering godzilla instead those you wondering mulder discovers that the truth indeed out there who cares did find the series would over anyway what are you complaining about the dialogue interesting and the director marvelous the camera almost always looking over the shoulder our heroes feel are right there with them when they open door climb hill the script spotless every thing that happens happens for purpose you are confused something not worry because will all become clear later but and cannot stress this enough pay attention unlike most summer movies the dialogue twice important the effects miss one vital piece information and like most people who talk during movies you will home and tell all your friends how this movie made sense also those people who need the bathroom during movies don the person who watched the movie with had twice and twice she missed important conversation there time take breather between scenes because again unlike most summer movies godzilla anybody the files does not need fill scenes between the suspense and the action with useless subplots every scene crucial and serves purpose who needs see the blond chiouaoua have big emotional scene between godzilla attacks far this summer have seen only one movie who ranks higher list movies recommend and that the truman show but only wins nose but the truman show not what would call summer movie the files what more you ask from summer movie other than the chance excited cool effects good some pulse pounding hell yes strangely enough think that fans the series will hate this movie while non fans will have good time does not provide answers the show many questions the status quo remains nearly the same and mulder and scully not get together rating four and half out five stars for the best movie yet this summer several jump right out your seat thrills many whoah never saw that one coming moments four holy shit where the hell did that come from and one heck ending you may wonder where this movie lost half star well swore never give movie the full five stars had find something about the his ice truck the tracks leaves

found examining couple jackie chan films watch the restaurant fight from the film rush hour and notice that the context the fight while technically amazing rather flat the framing and cut always not

1 |text let open this one with confession love cop movies adore them with such unwavering near foolish passion that was actually one the first line see 1998 one tough cop starring the smirkiest the baldwin brothers steven was any good well just about good baldwin steven seagal impression for those confused the answer resounding now let clarify don love just any cop movie not too keen the smug buddy cop flicks that were vogue the and now slowly gulp returning thanks jackie chan and chris tucker partial those gritty earthy cop dramas like serpico donnie brasco and the french connection problem these films come along just about often george bush makes cogent point whenever true cop movie does hit multiplexes come running towards like eager puppy and inevitably leave head bowed tripping over squiggly tail what about cop movies that transform into moron willing shell out for movie called one tough cop which actually sounds lot like wiseguy spin off truth sucker for those barren streets that gritty graffiti strewn modernist jungle where dangerous criminals lurk and cops like modern day knights must shield from their iniquitous clutches yes all very corny and awfully boys clubish which guessing precisely where these feelings come from little tots boys are brought create our own wars with joe enact cops and robbers cowboy and indian fantasies etc the best gritty cop films tap into those gleeful adolescent fantasies and heighten them turning all into existential nightmare thin moral lines and psychological chaos adult tastes haven changed all that drastically sure can get cerebral high from the emotional complexities krzysztof kieslowski film but still delight the promise guy film could potentially bring now what the cops who the corrupt ones ooh that one really gets going these protectors using all that their service taking advantage others for their own gain throw courtroom drama yech into the pot and you have the tremendously absorbing sidney lumet film prince the city how absorbing prince the city you ask damn absorbing that when the film shifts from gritty undercover cop drama courtroom drama sub genre loath the way kristy swanson must loath sarah michelle gellar remained completely and utterly involved the film stars treat williams who gives the kind performance that should have skyrocketed his career the level that brad pitt currently resides since was hatched mere two years prior the release prince the city cannot provide answer why didn though judging from his recent roles tripe like deep rising and dead heat would guess that probably has something with quite few bad career moves like mickey rourke and eric roberts both whom are currently doing time direct video purgatory williams talented leading man who didn make where should have there was any justice this dog gone world keanu reeves would the one banished direct video hell here the actor given role not all that dissimilar from pacino serpico also directed lumet williams plays danny ciello member elite squad police officers who take down drug dealers the gritty pre juliani streets new york they work without uniforms hours much like paid vigilantes and that analogy more than apt seeing how the bunch are kinda sorta forced into using corrupt means get the job done the squad relies entirely informants low level junkies gain access the big wigs and order obtain the info they seek they sometimes have provide the junkies with the junk their choice danny has done this and though fairly honorable guy who took the job order good his intentions have gotten bit skewed along the way seeks redemption and concludes that the best way about getting talking internal affairs who then convince him undercover double agent does with one condition will not rat his partners right away know that that exactly what have and watching the movie build that thrilling the way that any great character driven story can undercover cop films are almost innately exciting even the kind that pull out all the cliches like too deep how can one not moved the issues betrayal ambiguity and the danger putting oneself such risky position prince the city takes all this and charges with perceptive hard boiled script and taut unintrusive direction old pro sidney lumet well handful intense performances most notably treat lumet greatest contribution the movie how lays back and lets the camera soak the action his scenes transition rapidly from one the next building layers tension and rarely holds for reaction shots instead clicks away precisely the moment character stops yakking lumet worst tendency one that many film makers especially oliver stone tend overuse relies little too heavily actors shouting their lines each other presumably order ratchet the tension this isn much problem here was night falls manhattan lumet most recent cop lawyer endeavor movie that nearly gave ulcer from just watching though late lumet has made several really awful career choices maybe and treat should get together for drink something the most recent completely unnecessary remake gloria here was sustaining tension film that runs for 167 minutes with not one dull spot some the formula pictures like the best are the most simplistic hollywood often forgets how easy make these kinds pictures even tolerable course cop movies aren popular anymore yes buddy cop flicks are popular but those are more like extended sitcoms with gunfire amid the punch lines but just look the average hollywood action movies flicks bloated and full unnecessary fat like the boring love interest that serves purpose other than stall the action and demonstrate that our hero isn gay the lame comic relief character who never funny and and for all its moral ambiguities prince the city back the basics cop courtroom drama that leaves out all the crap and really thrills focuses completely its story and its characters all whom are completely believable from the cops the lawyers the junkies there great scene early where irate williams shouts officer and looks about into one those corny braveheart inspirational speeches but instead breaks down front the cop and begins sobbing this scene that would never make into michael bay film even though bruce willis sacrifices his life the end armageddon not one damn tear would cut out because the director would say that makes him too human excuse weak the very next scene danny speaks hushed raspiness straining get the words out lost his voice does that little itty bitty detail matter maybe not most but sure made night and sprawling epic corruption greed betrayal and violence nice see that someone paying attention the little things
1 |text after hearing reviews for woody allen upteenth movie history celebrity range from terribly boring just heart lept when the opening images the film closely resembled that manhattan personal favorite from personal favorite director all time woody allen films almost never rely visual flair over textual flair when one his films closely resembles the one time that these two entities fit hand hand manhattan really one the best looking films ever seen beautiful black and white photography the city best areas etc fan can help but feel visibly moved the film opens with the usual credits with plain white font over black backgrounds and old ironic standard playing the soundtrack but then the screen fills with gorgeous dull gray sky with the word help being spelled with airplane beethoven 5th blasts the soundtrack the city seems stop take notice this moment and all rather lovely look and then cut film crew shooting this the film hilariously banal key moment the film where the lead actress the film melanie griffith looking buxom and beautiful ever has realize something wrong with her life whatever terribly stale scene for woody allen film with the great opening shots without and heart sank and soon got used the fact that once again new film his was not going great his past works though for the record last year deconstructing harry came awfully close what the hell has happened him the man who once could relied for neurotic freshness cinema has not become less funny but his films have become less insightful and more like tossed them together out unfinished ideas bullets over broadway though wonderful relies irony pull farce that just never totally takes off mighty aphrodite more full great moments and lines than really great story everyone says love you was more great idea than great film even deconstructing harry admittingly cheap way even does top one his most truly hilarious films anything the reception celebrity everyone should tip allen off the fact that this time not the audience and critics who are wrong about how wonderful his film him celebrity yes good film but only marginally satisfying woody allen film instead creating the great woody allen world created world out subject knows only bit about and fashioned film that based almost entirely his uninformed philosophy celebrities that plays like series skits with minor connections like dolce vita without the accuracy the right amount wit and the correct personal crisis woody becoming more insecure his old age choses drop the woody allen character the world celebrities and then hang him and all his flaws for scrutiny and does this casting not himself but brit actor kenneth branagh the lead much has been said about his performance dead but irritating makes one yearn for the real thing blah blah blah but anyone who actually knows the woody allen character knows that branagh performance though featuring some the same mannerisms stuttering whining lots hand gestures hardly warts and all impersonation branagh brings along with him little the woody allen charm which actually allows for his character flaws more apparent woody flawed guy and know but love him anyway because really funny and really witty and really intelligent branagh allen bit more flat out bad but with the same charm that yes like him but still not sure really good person not his character lee simon first seen the set the aforementioned movie hits extra actress winona ryder then goes off interview griffith who takes him her childhood home where makes pass her and she denies him sorta then learn through flashbacks that lee has been sucked into trying celebrity thanks mid life crisis and appearance his high school reunion has since quit his job travel journalist and become gossip journalist sorts covering movie sets and places where celebrities congregate that can meet them and maybe sell his script bank robbery movie but with deep personal crisis such has divorced his wife several years allen regular judy davis and continues quest for sexual happiness boucing from girlfriend girlfriend and fling fling over the course the film after griffith comes his escapades with model charlize theron who polymorphously perverse glad see allen using new jokes who takes him for wild ride not different from that the anita ekberg segment dolce vita following are his safe relationship with smart working woman famke janssen relationship that almost assures him success and his continued escapades with ryder whom fancies most all his story juxtaposed with that davis who flips out but stumbles onto happiness when she runs into handsome friendly exec joe mantegna who lands her job that furthers her career national status while lee fumbling about selfishly trying ensure his own happiness davis becomes happy become the kind woman always hated and loving without doing thing the result film highs and mediums the mediums are what take most the film with sitations and scenes which don exactly work but you can help but pat allen the back for trying but other places are really great scenes the opening the sequence with theron which good that wished hadn ended banana scene with bebe neuwirth droll ever and perhaps the best sequence romp with hot hell teen idol brandon darrow played none other than leo dicaprio who dicaprio esque that any this fans could sit through this film they never look him the same way ignites the screen with intensity and spares nothing showing his character narcissistically tyrannical and totally heartbreaking for lee who comes him talk about his script that has read and finds himself wild all day ride with him they atlantic city watch fight they gamble and they wind his hotel room where darrow gets with his flame gretchen mol and lends him one the leftover groupies allen writing these scenes are good that just for them almost recommend the film almost but what really liked about this film despite the fact that mess despite the fact that what this film really needs good old fashioned rewrite allen himself still smart and insightful film though some the jokes are either stale misplaced some seem too cartoonish even for this environment allen still manages get across that this film not exactly about celebrities may seem were extremely out touch but about those who want celebrities and how they equate celebrity hood with happiness never get close enough the actual celebrities see they really happy they may appear the surface but get close enough lee and davis character lee obsessed with the phenomenon while davis takes arm length and never gets too involved what and soon becomes one herself besides witty and does have the one thing that other film has but allen that great woody allen feel may not exactly fresh and lively totally brilliant its depiction its subject and yes part woody allen oeuvre merely blip annie hall but shadows and fog either but goes prove that one can make film like him and only and maybe

see tom cruise drop kick face less villains while his hair whips stylishly the wind cool for sure but made empty the movie the actor isn used much for his boyish appeal for his chiseled looks smiles narcissistically into the camera literally any moment during gunfight before one after one when not beaming away staring into the lens with cold eyes trying look mad hell but woo editing seriously undermines the effort fetishizes cruise angular face with such glee that turns into naked gun style spoof half expected cruise peel off his facemask and reveal that really austin powers classic woo

into motorcycle attack which bad guys seem angle directly for cruise kill them like some kind mass suicide ritual one dumb bastard even jumps his bike over the gun toting cruise basically inviting our handsome hero shoot him mid air which does the lead bad guy played the appropriately british dougray scott and cruise face off mentally deficient game chicken motorcycles though instead jumping off the side the last moment the two grown men leap directly into the other giving each other mid air bear hug only fly about hundred feet still bear hug position land beach below and begin mano mano fist fight that ends with the bad guy pulling you thought was dead not worry cruise takes care the problem without even breaking sweat what hero you may have noticed that opted not describe iota mi2 plot reasoning simple not sure any good would the film itself has absolutely concern with story only with hurtling forth the next special effect wasn kidding when told friend mine that mi2 has less plot than the average aerosmith video nobody will this for the plot and they they surely regret summer movies evolve devolve character and plot have become increasingly whittled down nearly nothing the plot seemed built around brian palma that film director stylistic flourishes while mi2 the plot only serves give intermittent breather from woo non stop masturbatory pandemonium irrelevant every sense

-1 |text were one those arrogant critics who thinks his review has some great impact the success failure certain films might say that review movies that don look particularly good because doing service readers warning them against seeing that were true could put banner the top site that reads shay casey seeing bad movies you don have but know that bunk you going see whatever movies you want matter what say have tell the truth every once while get nasty masochistic urge see bad movie you know the feeling when you sick seeing all these damn academy award contenders and you want see something you can have ball trashing mercilessly sometimes think that why anyone goes see pauly shore movies ever admit sometimes you like seeing bad movies saw supernova truth told supernova wasn quite bad thought might maybe just felt sorry for the actors maybe thought could have been decent the studio hadn started tinkering with the director walter hill final cut causing him want his name removed maybe becoming softy any case didn find supernova bad the advance buzz would have believe but still bad the film takes place aboard the medical space vessel nightingale the crew includes captain marley robert forster his new second officer nick vanzant james spader head medical officer kaela evers angela bassett medical technicians yerzy penalosa lou diamond phillips and danika lund robin tunney and computer technician benj sotomejor wilson cruz there are some attempts characterization but all that means that nick has shady past involving drug addiction which puts kaela edge yerzy and danika have relationship that requires them make kissy faces each other every five minutes and benj apparently gay love with the computer apparently female don expect any more explanation because you won get anyway the crew gets distress call from location deep space which failed mining operation had been sent during the dimension jump think that what called but don hold the captain killed and the man who sent the distress signal peter facinelli brought board calls himself troy larson making him the supposed son man kaela once had relationship with then bunch really predictable stuff starts happening have you seen alien have you seen event horizon lame movie its own right good then you seen supernova post production cuts not there nothing original about this screenplay and nothing unpredictable either after all one going think for second that troy won turn out villain but the bigger problem with supernova that can just stick the simple plot afforded numerous writes the script may credited three people but gross underestimate have crammed this lean minute film with tons extraneous plot threads that all remain underdeveloped was there something about limping robot shaped like fighter pilot did the ship computer learn something about humanity what was that glowing lava lamp artifact troy brought board with him and just what does the film title signify anything far can tell refers very small plot detail that isn developed just like the rest these unnecessary story elements character relationships this film also make very little sense for some reason every person this film keeps having sex get unusually early sex scene between phillips and tunney within the first minutes bassett and spader characters start off hating each other fifteen minutes and one bottle pear brandy later they engaging some hanky panky when troy the creepy stranger shows the ship course both female crew members will fall love with him every single shift character interaction happens extremely suddenly which only one the many obvious clues how much this film has been cut the most prominent example however may the fact that when the film starts there are opening credits furthermore the end the film looks like they took what were originally intended the opening credits and spliced them right before the real end credits maybe that why the film title mentioned twice during the end credits right between james spader and robert forster right after you get over the shock not being told what movie you seeing lest you decide walk out upon making that discovery you might notice that the movie seems have dropped you right the middle scene with little introduction any the characters situations the rest the movie feels like they skipped over the middle stuff the character changes you know where they explain things and just went from point point point danika thoroughly enamored yerzy and ready have his baby point tunney now shagging troy and yerzy unusually obsessed with the lava lamp thing doesn make sense since didn understand anything about these characters motivations did care when troy abruptly starts murdering them one one and does knocking off three them about minutes not whit shame because this cast contains lot talented actors looking for something they don find bassett and spader say every line the same monotone voice with the same blank expressions their faces sexual tension more like constipation maybe they just embarrassed having utter such howlers this thing was made someone more powerful than god and whole lot less nice not that ever find out who that mind you the climax their relationship taking place transport pod probably the film biggest forehead slapper troy peter facinelli inhabits the most obvious villain history that one ever suspected awfully one note but not given any more notes work with the rest the cast does even less tunney stands around looking cute then scared phillips broods cruz flirts with the computer then they all die and star blows something but really wasn paying much attention then supernova pretty awful but cutting little slack merely because expected less than what got that you expect good for whatever reasons you may have you probably hate more than will even the special effects are fairly unimpressive nothing you haven seen before and suffice say the script isn going save the film

might not had and though its kill killed approach business was exaggerated that very ideology was keyed into the mind set the quintessential reagan era businessman stone constructed his film mythical good evil tale relayed the fast paced milieu the burgeoning stock exchange critics and audiences lauded wall street elevating its status that contemporary classic proud say that will never counted one them found wall street just axiomatic and pandering the majority stone output with its thin caricatures obvious sentiments and charisma barren performance the young charlie sheen stone goes for broke every scene the same could said for nearly all his works this approach tends bury his purported message beneath heap good intentions directs stock exchange scenes typical hyperbolic mode with people shouting into phones they were plummeting airplane all excuse for stone ratchet the emotion with false intensity rather than explore what these situations are really like have feeling the brokers would psychologically manipulative they are presented boiler room rather than laughably over the top these guys are salesmen after all not televised judges more than anything baffled why many adore wall street the only possible solution can muster its release date and not just the timeliness the greed good subject matter the film was plumped down the eighties decade which the one joke comedy rose art form and group glamorous brat packers smirked their way through inane high concept low result movies mind the eighties will forever remembered decade with not only proliferation bad movies but bad music bad hair and bad clothes maybe stone after school special set wall street was viewed welcome change pace boiler room equally well timed film with some similarities stone piece crap they both feature consequential father son relationship though boiler room much more subtle and touching and they are both concerned with the power greed yet the men boiler room are akin poseurs presuming big shots rather than the slippery smooth heartless gordon gecko figures wall street boiler room message movie well though least until the end doesn shove our faces boiler room about the pursuit cash and the degrees which people will for that cash said this film indeed timely society where who wants millionaire the number one prime time show every day bringing about revolution prime time watching that hasn been seen quite while not only want millionaires want watch other people become millionaires our super judgmental power oriented culture the desire for money supersedes everything when you have money you have all and seth giovanni ribisi wants all the easy way well intentioned college drop out who gets lured into working for illegally run brokerage firm the kind that sells junk stock whereupon meets others just like him ben affleck cast jim the company headhunter who struts commanding the room like frat boy gordon gecko his job influence trainee into becoming enthusiastic employees giving speech that subtly attacks their man hood ironic that sells these pups the same load that they told dish out prospective buyers affleck character obviously supposed recall alec baldwin similar character glengary glen ross and that proves detrimental the actor performance affleck shouts curses and littles his rookie employees just like baldwin minus the edge when alec played the scene became the part spewing those brutal lines they were his own comparison affleck simply looks were doing really hammy line reading the brokers approach their job with the fervor overzealous jocks they storm work like football players the way the big game rap music thumps the soundtrack effectively illustrating who these guys think they are intellectual gangsters they aren above rumble test man hood especially during leisure time where the lumbering scott caan seems all too eager use his fists minor disputes drink this world along with seth and watch him become seduced just like might all cautionary tales boiler room begins with seducing into its illustrious world profit and wrongdoing then smacks with the consequences all the recklessness know this story all but can work told with intelligence and energy and that how writer director ben younger tells director please excuse french mise scene younger has much learn his style sitcom bland but his writing isn younger script well studied the vernacular this bunch his dialogue like junior david mamet despite the moderate camera work younger fills his phone pitch scenes with tension that comes from just the performances and the tightly wound script the brokers hucksters counter every customer objection gently bullying them into buying stock these moments are filmed like psychological action scenes tense confrontation between victimizer and victim who isn aware that one with the exception affleck brief appearances the performances are truly exceptional ribisi who has the edgy looks character actor extremely potent here working his pale angular face and eerie plaintive stare for all their worth conveys child like vulnerability his character seems hide corner whenever things aren going his way some scenes and others ferociously cut throat the jekyll and hyde contradiction works well the movie ribisi confident when just him and the phone but cowardly front authority figures including his abrasive father authoritatively played ron rifkin boiler room thankfully avoids wall street like histrionics the sales pitch sequences the sales build slowly like crescendo intelligent psychological ploys those ploys are taught seth chris vin diesel kind broker who alternates between seth friend and his mentor diesl shines his minor role this week saw the sci opus pitch black which diesel plays completely different role equally effective manner that film has the kind role that might have gone arnold schwarzenegger the and boiler room has the kind role that might have gone elliot gould the nicky katt also memorable superior broker obsessed with what can have nia long the firm secretary lone black women amongst many white men ribisi love interest part that first looks insignificant most the parts this talented actress gets but develops into something more interesting the two make oddly likeable couple long smart and brash and ribisi charmingly aloof one point says her just lookin for some chocolate love terrible line but ribisi delivers such innocuous child like way becomes sweetly endearing unfortunately towards the end the boiler room turns tad schmaltzy there much crying hugging and sorrowful stares this okay when taken small doses but younger conclusion constructed series these boo hoo moments one following the other particular misstep his attempt show the effect that seth manipulations have one his poor victims not bad idea but the execution lacking with those scenes feeling tacked further spell out the message that message being greed bad yes patently obvious but boiler room conveys introducing culture that haven seen much the movies the disenfranchised twenty something entrepreneur and all wall street did was introduce simplistic fantasy world saints and sinners boiler room offers neither extreme gives what between and for that thankful

-1 |text friend here film school just made two minute long film for one his classes that includes staged anal rape scene done two guys and shot the shadow the incident with banana being used the instrument penetration sick this all watching one the most admittingly hysterical moments ever witnessed sure may bad taste but what the hell bad taste other than something that may offensive some but riotously amusing the rest then there caligula this film features incest necrophilia beastuality anal rape homosexual felatio both sexes elaborate and lengthy orgies greased fist forced man rear wine poured down man who had his urinary tracts tied off penis chopped off and fed hungry dogs etc etc etc this could very well respectable film and could have been had the following not occurred the events were graphically shot clear view the tone was not that trying shock comically but well show historical accuracy the film was million dollar production with lavish sets rather impressive cast and whopping hour running time produced and funded none other than bob guccione owner penthouse magazine caligula comes across the most hysterical dramatic picture since plan from outer space because underneath there sense that everything this film doing not only accurate and justified but also brilliantly entertaining after all not really the fact that this film features the aforementioned disgusting moments but that actually believes them dramatic weaponry film should discarded because its content because film never about what about about how about the old cliche goes those who bash this film for content are glancing over the biggest and most obvious problem with caligula and that that nothing but overdramaticized bullshit from start finish without second credibility its mammoth running time caligula allegedly tells the true story the evil roman emporer the same name man who was insanely decadent that his assasination came blessing guess even though almost every single roman emporer was assasinated well and for much the same reasons the film opens the wrong note course with quote from mark appearing before any image graces the screen using the over used passage what shall profit man should gain the whole world dlose his own soul depite the fact that the opening scene the film the emporer before was emporer fucking around with his own sister field suppose one has lose their soul one has have soul the first place the plot incomprehensibly done that all anyone else can make out that caligula disastrously played the great malcom mcdowell performance that does the opposite that his performance clockwork orange did next line for the throne but can wait for the current emporer tiberius peter toole ditto only for his performance lawrence arabia his grandfather die kills him and ascends the throne then abuses his position marries woman helen mirren who retains her dignity actor not exactly acting doesn just have sleep with his sister dreadful teresa ann savoy there pretty naked and willing hop the sack with mac anyone asks her hop with abuses his position little more little more and little more and then believe invades england then killed off the filler instead recounting his life supposed guccione claims the ultimate portrait decadent pagan rome complete with orgies vicious deaths and lots nudity but instead being the historical accurate film really really wants instead becomes guccione twisted masturbatory image what could like isn great that they just loved having sex and that they killed people disgustingly and wouldn great could make couple bucks selling this shit off accuracy even though blatantly real bad porn that completely convinced myself that not mean why not just show roman orgy when can spend good ten minutes examining every single facet that makes and not just that disgusting vile whatever adjective you want use describe this film that film where the entire feel going for isn felt also the sloppiest expensive movie all time the sets are lavish but blatantly innacurate that wonder historian wanting have his name this film explains this but that doesn matter since the cinematography dark that you wonder light meter was used all making this not only dark and ugly but just plain dark the camera operation also the worst ever seen entire life not only does this film hold the record for the most unnecessary zooms one single shot ever but often the camera will lose its subjects and pan around till they find them then have them out focus the editing sloppy that some scenes are absolutely impossible follow there writer speak what the hell does mean that adapted from original screenplay gore vidal but nevertheless the dialogue shit laughably bad that can good faith believe that anyone with over could say them with straight face favorite being the line when caligula inquires the doctor about the health the dying tiberius could any moment but with care could last year the music this film mostly prokofiev and khachaturian they use his gorgeous adagio spartacus and phrygia nauseum used attempt give the film some emotion but instead feels was shipped from elsewhere the orgy scenes and one infamous lesbo scene between penthouse pets lori wagner and aneeka dilorenzo are the result reshoots guccione himself which are obviously removed from everything else this film that only adds the embrassment every five seconds the film cuts random nudity was afraid its audience would forget this film rated john gielgud represents the only voice sanity walking around his brief role was constantly the mantra going kill agent going kill agent and and for over hours making caligula about exciting and enriching three hour college lecture class and twice deliriously annoying guccione his pursuit historical accuracy has instead made film that such painstaking arduous task watch its entirety that doubt anyone can sit through hour without irreversible psychological damage throughout the entire film the presence guccione easily felt were standing there the edge the screen pretentiously looking down upon saying look what can get away with and you don like this then you prig and worse than that you know nothing about history huh there clear difference between historical accuracy and doing something that artistically good film which showed roman decadence something that was perhaps liberating for some but could not last that would probably make for good film but using historical accuracy licence get away with any kind disgusting for disgustingness sake acts total total bullshit and all can say that guccione and the makers this film have lost any kind touch with either entertainment eroticism and have developed pathetic and sadistic taste for both judging from this film there film that came out 1989 called the cook the thief his wife and her lover magnifcent film legendary cult director peter greenaway also starring helen mirren which deals with graphic sex heartstopping violence and gore and even little cannibalism for good measure that film not only never patronized its viewers but also handled them way that was shocking yes but also bizarre way entertaining and totally involving there were real characters there real situation and best all passion and just the right amount restraint not get off the fact that going offensive many that film achieved everything wanted and has since retained status one those cult films that not only popular but actualy good and everything caligula might have been but alas wasn

1 |text the reunion film not original idea any way shape form been done throughout film history over and over again and has become one the many sub genres like the prep school sub genre the angst filled teen sub genre and the slasher sub genre what makes peter friends remarkable not how doesn follow the rules this sub genre but how follows well and creates characters that wouldn mind hanging with what are the rules the reunion sub genre well you need group friends most them married least dating and sometimes even married dating eachother you need have them brought back together over some sort crisis they are not have spoken together much since they split apart the reunion has come intervals divisible they all have slightly highly neurotic the reunion has bring them together seperate them with little crises then bring them back together because after all they friends there has some sex least some making out either between the friends with other people that are there were invited eightly they all unhappy marginally there some sort sexual tension amongst some them that built over the years the friends are all wildly successful the world entertainment and the arts sometimes internationally the film filled with nostalgic radio hits from the time when they were friends sometimes causing them get together dance song since follows these rules closely will probably and has been coined off just british big chill and some ways both follow the rules said and both feature lots bitching big confessionals and broken relationships but while the big chill was least tad too whiny and unsatisfying peter friends hits its mark making this film funny dramatic and poignant the friends peter were all the same theatre group back performig wildly outrageous british acts for people far too stuck enjoy them the opening scene has them all dancing tux tops and tutus after peter stephen fry wealthy father richard briers hardly screen enough register but well dies leaving giant mansion him has decide whether not keep not sure what with immeadiately decides throw giant reunion party inviting back all his old chums course all most his chums follow the tenth rule andrew kenneth branagh also directing here actor who unhappily married star carol writer rita rudner maggie emma thompson successfuly publisher self help books but looks like she needs them more than her customers she lonely and unhappy roger and mary hugh laurie and imelda staunton who were also married sense and sensibility are married and are the most successful creators jingles the but have suffered tragedy one their newly born twins has recently died and sarah alphonsia emmanuel promiscuous ever having new boyfriend two weeks named brian tony slattery who married and wants divorce because her giving her doubts for peter things seem okay the film features lots inner friend jokes and even some old theatre anecdotes which least find lot fun done lots theatre myself and there are big confessions brawls between the friends and the end almost everyone unhappy even though some have resolved their problems long before the end which kinda dug the final twist would seem forced anti climactic but for some reason felt the same way the rest the friends did maybe because the people this film are likable that just wanted join their clique that really what makes peter friends lovable the way you just want hang with group friends who can dysfuntional sometimes but when someone crisis can come together wonderfully for one another when you have giant crisis like this and people want selflessly help you out instead subtely pushing you away that makes you realize you have true friends and these people are true friends not mention kenneth branagh able make the film seem nostalgic for the 80s decade grew unfortunately without taking outside the 90s there are some 80s classics and anti classics like tears for fears everybody wants rule the world but unfortunately stupid fun 80s songs think ever did 80s reunion film put some crap gos song least some good old come eileen but this the british 80s talking about well but anyway the direction pretty good although nothing amazing branagh forte really making shakespeare fresh and magical but least very good with making less ambiguous film like this the writing good from rita rudner and martin bregman with lots good one liners and even some really bad but good puns mock the fact that andrew lives peter while cutting some logs asks him has wood and andrew says but have hollywood punishment like that the actors most speaking movies are better than their material though with some stand out performances the six friends well the outsiders like slattery rudner and phyllida law the old housekeeper the peter mansion little note should made about hugh laurie performance looks like took some massive doses prozac before doing this mean never seen him actually act this dramatically peter friends really enjoyable film which makes people like pine for some sort future reunion although don know what kind have like most people don look forward high school reunion because the way these friends are still able maintain the same amount care they have for one another and after such long period seperation just look forward the day when can have friends like that

1 |text historical epic genre was almost banished from hollywood early 1990s for many critics scholars and most importantly film producers was thing the past something that could have attracted crowds only the era black and white television and non cgi special effects but 1995 same the case dances with wolves five years ago there came the man who decided use all his energy and talents actor producer and director order revitalise that particular genre and same the case dances with wolves was awarded for his effort with oscars the name the film was braveheart and the name its director and main actor was mel gibson the plot chronicles the life scottish warlord and folk hero william wallace 1272 1305 his time english king edward longshanks played patrick mcgoohan has almost completely subdued entire british isles including scotland whose proud inhabitants are now subjected ius primae noctis and various other forms humiliation and oppression english knights although english had killed his father many years ago young scottish commoner william wallace played mel gibson doesn care about politics and wants only have peaceful life with his new bride murron played catherine maccormack murron death changes that and wallace takes arms and together with small but dedicated band followers begins guerrilla campaign that would systematically destroy almost every english garrison the country through time more and more people join his ranks and 1298 wallace rag tag army scores surprising victory against english knights the battle stirling bridge but the newly won freedom endangered the internal squabbles between scots themselves especially nobles under pretender robert the bruce played angus macfadyen who wouldn like have simple commoner national leader braveheart was only the second film the directorial career mel gibson wouldn fair compare the better known genre classics directed david lean anthony mann however even when apply such criteria braveheart more than decent historical epic that takes new and refreshing approach the genre the most noticeable element this approach naturalism while older hollywood films set medieval europe used give fairytale like vision picturesque castles splendid costumes and knights shining armour gibson shows the extremely unpleasant world poverty and feudal injustice where might made right and life was hard short and brutish this general unpleasantness especially underlined the scenes battle where hand hand combat naturalistically displayed all its gory details never seen since verhoeven ultra naturalistic flesh blood compared with this naturalistic approach most old hollywood epics look like stage plays braveheart also employs humour the right places not only make bloody realities medieval british isles more bearable sensitive audiences but also underline its down earth atmosphere different from previous historical epics what makes braveheart larger than life his protagonist mel gibson obviously invested plenty his energy and talent bringing the mythical figure william wallace and result character 15th century poems transformed into superhuman being that resembles late 20th century comic book hero wallace more than superior his enemies both physically and mentally yet able show his sensitive more vulnerable side naturally when the character based epic poems most historical accuracy going down the drain which was the case with almost every historical epic from hollywood 1990s however even those who don particularly care about history are willing give poetic license scriptwriter randall wallace might think that went over the top idolising wallace especially the second part film when scottish superhero manages seduce princess isabel played sophie marceau and make her child because that the disbelief hardly suspended and final scenes aren effective they should mel gibson actor truly wonderful and also helped small army very good british and irish actors most memorable them all patrick mcgoohan whose cold calculated and evil medieval monarch one the most effective villains seen contemporary cinema brendan gleeson who would later become famous for his role boorman general also very good wallace trusted companion well ian bannen effective leprosy stricken king john balliol david harra very entertaining wallace irish ally and angus macfadyen brings lot anxiety into his conscience stricken character robert the bruce women this film have rather thankless roles especially marceau one dimensional french princess catherine mccormack wallace wife was more interesting but she was eliminated from the picture early from the technical point view the film also very good photography john toll brings lot scottish natural beauty the screen the other hand the musical score james horner employs too much modern day instruments for period piece set medieval times although mostly welcomed critics and audiences alike braveheart was often criticised for homophobia and other forms extreme conservatism the main reason for that was the fact that gibson among many historical facts chose faithful only those related sexual orientation longshank son prince

fact these scenes are barely referred again had sinking feeling during these opening scenes generally hospital scene that set with poor lighting filthy interiors and evil doctors sure sign that you are the throes truly horrible movie the movie cuts again this time the present the young man whose name jeffrey played jeffrey donovan the first movie the character names are identical the actors names although this movie admits front that fictional there reason for the practice this time around rounding group people that will leading into the woods that weekend for the blair witch hunt which promotional gimmick came with and sells his website meet tristen and steven young couple who are writing book about the blair witch experience steven skeptic believing the whole thing the result mass hysteria tristen the other hand believes that there may some truth the rumors supernatural occurrence she wan and soft spoken she complains that the radio playing too loudly she also complains that she feels nauseated knew immediately that the character was pregnant and intuition was confirmed few scenes later when kim psychomagically susses out how did know because bad movies nauseated women are always pregnant the fourth member their party erica wiccan with flowing hair and wide eyes who wants prove that the blair witch was good witch not evil they pick the fifth and final team member cemetery kim dressed completely black has extreme goth style makeup and occasionally displays seemingly psychic abilities but otherwise seems the most intelligent and reasonable person out the entire bunch presumably she wanted picked the cemetery just for dramatic effect never explained the party five heads off into the woods promised they reach the crumbling ruins the foundation rustin parr house and set camp complete with extensive video equipment with which record the night events there brief encounter with rival blair witch tour group who had planned camp that site well but after few words are exchanged the rival group huffs off and makes camp elsewhere the movie veers off this point spend many long long minutes showing the drinking party that ensues after the sun goes down sexual innuendoes are tossed around much hard liquor beer and pot consumed and nothing much else happens this would great point get and the bathroom necessary the next day the team wakes and discovers that their camera equipment has been completely trashed and that steven and tristen manuscript paper fluttering down from the sky shreds like snow the videotapes are missing but thanks psychic intuition from kim they discover the videotapes buried underneath the foundation the house right where the original blair witch tapes were found ooh spooky the team goes back jeffrey house creepy old civil war era warehouse the heart the woods regroup and review the tapes they soon discover that the tapes mysteriously skip five hours the night wacky hijinks ensue tristen starts having weird dreams which she the blair witch everybody starts finding these weird rune like burn marks their bodies steven and erica have some highly disturbing mutual hallucinations and everything pretty much goes hell handbasket throughout the entire ordeal jeffrey and the others continue scrutinize the videotapes which seem have some kind weird images them about the point that the time jumps eventually tristen wanders mutters something about reverse and from this they somehow realize that they have play the tapes backwards when they this they discover what really happened during the five lost hours one the things they see the videotape footage themselves burying the videotapes okay the videotapes were being buried then how were they recording themselves nevermind this movie was awful simply awful the characters are broadly drawn caricatures that are never allowed any depth development erica the nature loving wiccan tristen the weak and sympathetic woman steven the overbearing asshole kim the antisocial goth girl old tired cliches were used illustrate these caricatures how know tristen weak and sympathetic because she pregnant how know kim antisocial goth girl because she wears lot eye makeup how know the local sheriff bad guy because has jagged teeth and talks like straight out deliverance this weak storytelling its worst rather than taking the time flesh out the characters and make them truly sympathetic the writer chose give each one few stereotypical characteristics attempt use some cinematic shorthand and thereby skip straight the action didn work top being poorly developed most the characters were either seriously unlikable patently stupid honey you just had miscarriage out the woods and got medical attention hospital that looks like belongs bad slasher movie let get plane home having these bizarre nightmares and seeing strange visions and want find out what going frankly the end the movie was rooting for the witch also felt that there was simply too much blood gore this film the first movie worked never showing the horror the witch was palpable presence that movie but never saw never saw anything fact the horror was all off screen and thus our imaginations worked overtime envision what might possibly this the hallmark truly creepy and disturbing horror movie blair witch dispensed with such niceties and went straight for the gross out this was evident from the opening scenes the mad doctors forcing white goo down jeffrey throat and continued throughout the film the audience treated occasional confusing and disorienting footage what appears ritual massacre some sort knives plunge into flesh bloody fingers trail off into the darkness and none explained until the very end when was too late for care this movie didn stop with showing the gore either went for broke and showed everything the end the movie there are questions remaining about the missing five hours all explained fact all shown screen loving detail confess being someone who prefers horror movies which you never see the monster see only brief glimpses mere suggestions what the monster not because find the monster terrifying but because find the absence the monster infinitely more terrifying have seen interviews with the director which suggested that there monster that all the evil was perpetrated only the human mind found this miserably poor explanation was fact the director intent then needs have some words with the writer because was not made clear all know lot people who like parties and get drunk and stoned out their minds none them has ever gone murderous rampage and then experienced mass hallucinations with group other people for the next week and there was witch then what about the vanishing tree the snowfall manuscript paper blair witch book shadows was horrible movie from the poorly written characters the implausible story the plot inconsistencies the gross out shots was bad effort through and through
1 |text robert redford very good playing characters who have incredible god given gifts but are able act like ordinary people the natural 1984 played the fallen angelic character roy hobbs the baseball player who was destined the best there ever was but still acted like humble farm boy butch cassidy and the sundance kid 1969 was the most dangerous shot the west yet came off like nothing more than boyishly good looking charmer even indecent proposal 1993 where played man who was good making money that believed could buy love redford was still able exude aura shy decency especially when reciting tale lost love his latest film the horse whisperer based the best selling novel nicholas evans redford again plays such character redford also directed the film although swore and down that would never direct himself movie suppose the character tom booker man who has the amazing gift understanding and somehow communicating with horses was just too good pass despite his enormous and rare gift when comes training troubled horses magazine article coins the phrase horse whisperer describe his uncanny talent booker sees himself everyday cattle rancher whose greatest fear growing old and longer having purpose life booker talents are taxed into service annie maclean kristin scott thomas new york magazine editor whose daughter grace scarlett johansson was recently horrible accident the accident which filmed with gut wrenching horror happens when grace and her best friend are out riding horses eighteen wheeler kills grace friend severely wounds and traumatizes grace horse pilgrim and causes grace lose part her right leg annie believes that pilgrim can healed grace will healed well which leads her booker first she tries get booker come new york see the horse but that doesn work instead she packs grace and pilgrim leaves her husband robert sam neill behind and heads for the rolling hills montana where booker runs ranch with his brother frank chris cooper and his sister law diane dianne wiest many ways the film like journey both literally and symbolically the move out west has always been great american tradition renewal and hard not see annie and grace leaving manhattan for montana variation the classic theme city country the horse whisperer country clearly the victor the city characterized claustrophobia and unhappiness and not until the characters arrive the wide open spaces montana that grace anger being physically and emotionally crippled begins dissipate annie controlling nature begins relax and pilgrim once again learns trust people redford just love with the grand montana country this film was when directed river runs through six years ago many ways the horse whisperer comes from the same poetic vein river and the movie could probably good fifteen minutes shorter redford had decided spend less camera time the grass and mountains but then that would ruin the magic much the film photography truly elegant and creates palpable sense the sheer expansiveness the land further emphasize this redford and cinematographer robert richardson natural born killers platoon cheated bit shooting the beginning the film which takes place new york with mostly cold harsh bluish filters and more squarish aspect ratio when the action shifts montana richardson switches soft focus and natural lighting and the screen widens aspect ratio terms the story itself the horse whisperer gives the same romanticized view adultery found david lean brief encounter 1945 and clint eastwood 1995 adaptation robert james waller the bridges madison county richard lagravenese screenwriter here also adapted bridges although the horse whisperer has strong romantic sensibility still find something oddly troubling about this kind story seems that there should some sympathy for the husband who being left behind for this brief heart sweeping affair but there rarely the horse whisperer the thankless role being the fuddy duddy husband falls sam neill plays the character decent hard working man who good husband and father his only failure that loves his wife more than she loves him risk losing annie booker not because did anything drive her away but simply because happens normal fairly uninspiring man there one scene that particularly telling how the movie feels about each character shows booker and robert going into horse pen booker dressed like classic cowboy with hat and all while robert looks somewhat frumpy and out place baseball cap they enter the pen booker assuredly swings over the fence while robert hesitates then opens the gate and goofy moment forgets close behind him small scene but clearly demonstrates the movie thorough love the booker character for his romantic roughness after all booker represents everything good about the city while robert represents everything banal and unnatural about the best scenes the horse whisperer tend involve not the building romance between booker and annie but rather the healing process grace and her horse although booker horse training methods are mythical and unrealistic the scenes with him and pilgrim are strangely mesmerizing these are paralleled the scenes between him and grace some which are humorous and all which are tender and true some point wished the movie would drop the whole romance angle and focus grace more nevertheless redford obviously romantic heart and brings light touch the erotic moments the film there are dramatic sex scenes but there moving scene when and scott thomas are slow dancing always moving ever closer together that far more erotic than any scene sweaty bodies grinding together although the movie longer than should and essentially melodramatic tearjerker with unsatisfying conclusion that guarantees unhappiness for just about every character there are enough moments like that which make the horse whisperer worth the price admission

-1 |text anything stigmata should taken warning against releasing similarly themed films relatively close one another the four supernatural horror flicks released this year clearly the worst suppose should have seen this coming after all blair witch thoroughly creeped out sixth sense was mildly spooky and then stir echoes had its moments but wasn anything lose sleep over clearly the quality the horror this summer has slowly been dropping then any surprise that stigmata the dullest most horribly executed piece mtv influenced tripe have seen long while not really patricia arquette plays frankie page hairdresser from pittsburgh who receives rosary gift from her globe trotting mother turns out the rosary belonged recently deceased brazilian priest the priest church had been under investigation father andrew kiernan gabriel byrne because the mysterious appearance bleeding statue father kiernan investigator who has made career out disproving supposed religious signs but this time believes there something the bleeding statue his investigation soon called off however when the frankie starts exhibiting signs the stigmata which person inflicted with wounds like that jesus christ father kiernan initially skeptical frankie story considering she atheist but once witnesses the stigmata attacks himself dedicates himself finding out what going eventually begins suspect that his boss cardinal houseman jonathan pryce concealing something that could bring down the catholic church turns out the dead priest had been working the translation fifth gospel before they were excommunicated the new rupert wainwright music video mean film stigmata the sort film that starts off and only gets worse indeed would have been good were music video because only interesting for about five minutes not sure what wainwright trying prove with his endless parade slow motion double exposure and extreme close ups whoaaaaaa other than the fact that has the most swelled head any director hollywood and yes has been film school his camera trickery interesting for little while but eventually becomes headache inducing what this film needed second audio track played over the dialogue such with wainwright screaming the audience see look what can cellent dir ect maybe then explain why decided start half his scenes with slow motion shots water dripping reverse why included random superfluous shots that egg frying ooh scary there was some underlying meaning behind all this camera trickery didn see just when you thought was safe get involved the story here comes double exposure shot two patricia arquettes collapsing into bed for reason whatsoever arrrrrrrghhhh then again the superfluous camera trickery wouldn bother stigmata had story characters that were remotely engaging though wainwright vanity certainly doesn help does seem have been given nearly unworkable script where are plot continuity and character development when you need them case point frankie page the character that assume are supposed identify and sympathize with but aren given any back story her character any reason like her the extent her character development seems that she hard working hairdresser who can somehow afford cavernous apartment the top floor her building and she kind cute let start the bleeding the fact that she clearly not the brightest bulb the drawer doesn help either according frankie page what the first thing after receiving mysterious wounds your wrists and back clubbing sure that makes sense arquette byrne and pryce give the old college try but their characters are one dimensional that they just appear sleepwalking scenes between arquette and byrne that were probably supposed sexually charged fall almost embarrassingly flat because the setup the romantic subplot clumsily handled that almost reaches the point becoming laughable even though frankie page life falling apart before her very eyes she still finds the time hit priest who wanders her hair salon even more curiously seems interested her advances father andrew religious doubt pops suddenly that seems more silly than dramatic for pryce may well wear curled mustache and cackle get you pretty for all the depth his cardinal houseman afforded trust not revealing anything telling you pryce turns out villain what worse after being faced with dull characters and the prospect having annoying camera tricks and loud music jammed down our throats now have contend with story that starts off one direction veers off another then another and ends being totally incomprehensible first all the film doesn even bother explain what should very simple plot details how does frankie get the stigmata merely touching rosary how come atheist like her was chosen since father andrew mentions that only very devout believers have ever received stigmata actually not sure what frankie was posessed supposedly stigmata occurs when one posessed the holy spirit but the film later has her being posessed the dead priest and later some evil spirit think which one the answer this question course very simple the possessing entity each scene determined whichever effects and flashy camera work wainwright wants use this time furthermore the ending ridiculously neat little wrap and the filmmakers compound this problem ultimately turning the film into diatribe against the catholic church you any research all about the gospel thomas you find that not being suppressed the church the film seems claim but that readily available your local library there nothing the catholics need worry about though stigmata religion off base that can confused for anything remotely resembling the real catholic church they wanted portray catholic priests mobsters they should have gone all out and equipped them with sharkskin suits and tommy guns which would have been far more interesting not catholic fact don care much for the catholic church but its cartoonish misrepresentation this film should not considered realistic any means rare see film that fails many levels stigmata does not thought provoking though would like and definitely not scary though pretends not sure why they tried pass this off horror film because there absolutely nothing scary about the story maybe attempt cover the fact that none the scenes have any dramatic weight whatsoever the initial shock seeing arquette covered with blood dulled the fact that happens over and over and over like many films the mtv generation this one suffers from overkill much overdone stigmata that eventually has effect the audience leaving pick out the film many flaws also still trying figure out why the quotation they take from the gospel thomas earth shattering when finally hear the saying sounds like something every five year old learns their first day sunday school which means that for all its flash the whole film really much ado about nothing the dog days summer usually produce one monstrous dog and stigmata

critic just what did expect out dumb teenage rock roll movie like this wondering the same thing feel like should have had grand time with detroit rock city the sort movie wish could had lot fun with but didn just didn surely this film isn trying win any major awards should have expected oscar caliber film but expected something funny joke clever prank plot development anything the movie never delivers you got marvel how the filmmakers managed come with movie that truly about nothing detroit rock city one those films that you walk out after the credits have rolled and realize that you just spent minutes watching movie which absolutely nothing happened justify the film existence and not very satisfying realization the film about four teenage boys all huge kiss fans from cleveland trying get into kiss concert detroit michigan that there big plot description this review because the movie has very little plot the characters are hawk edward furlong lex giuseppe andrews trip james debello and jam sam huntington they have garage band they pathetic like all garage bands but they like kiss and they like rock roll guess that means root for them they have tickets they lose them they get more tickets they lose those too they come with crazy schemes get tickets most which backfire there not much more frankly becomes little less than exciting see them try get kiss tickets about halfway through the film when total eight tickets have already graced the boys hands only lost because their sheer stupidity and jam real name jeremiah has really really annoying ultra religious mother who ought reported the child welfare agency she doesn want them see kiss you hadn figured that out already really quite disheartening see such fine soundtrack waste pointless movie like this got plenty kiss along with some ramones and thin lizzy then again maximum overdrive had awesome soundtrack being the big fan that but probably one the worst movies all time detroit rock city doesn quite reach that level ineptitude but gets dangerously close fact the music the only thing that keeps this movie from being complete failure mind basically the soundtrack has earned the film full half star which means all the bands involved can pat themselves the back except for marilyn manson whose half hearted cover highway hell sounds like something neighbor cat coughed also really sad see the talents the cast waste because evident that they all trying really hard squeeze some life out this dead turkey movie edward furlong has done far better work than this and has natasha lyonne and has lin shaye but hey they got make living hollywood people wanting see kiss and lots will probably disappointed considering the band appears for about five minutes and plays one song too bad they might have provided some energy this mess director adam rifkin knows hasn got much material work with takes chapter from the michael bay book directing and keeps his camera spinning get endless parade quick cuts split screens zoom outs zoom ins and rotating cameras all effort cover the sheer stupidity the script fun for while but eventually becomes disorienting would recommend that those who felt seasick the blair witch project stay far away from detroit rock city because the witch has got nothing this baby haven felt such urge reach out and hold the camera still since armageddon and what about that script written carl dupr which sounds like made name ever heard can say blame the writer for distancing himself far from this script possible plotless pointless rock roll movie can fun the jokes and gags are actually funny the jokes detroit rock city rarely are fact the only time really laughed was when priest gets stoned marijuana laced pizza and that was just because was surreal the rest the movie just seems like they just threw bunch vulgar stuff screen and called comedy there set just succession punchlines that don provide for much the way chuckles precisely because there was set they just whacked someone the head pointed him and said see funny look that woman was shocked hearing loud kiss music that she spilled her drink see funny look that guy just got clocked telephone receiver twice see funny look that kid has been vomiting for minutes after drinking inordinate amount alcohol and now about perform exotic dance for money see funny word advice dupr these things aren funny all themselves they must preceded clever set the audience hasn predicted them five minutes advance that said enough about this movie waste time and money liked the music but don bother buying the soundtrack hear just modern bands doing inferior versions the songs that are actually the movie you want see this concept executed well rent roger corman 1979 classic rock roll high school features another late seventies rock band the ramones and far more interesting story about girl trying get tickets their show yes rent that and skip detroit rock city which will probably bomb and deservedly

film starts with the invasion ancient china the huns led the imposing shan miguel ferrer soon china emperor pat morita mobilizes his armies and decrees that one male from each family the country shall

early are presented with the high importance bringing honor one family and botching her chance gaining the favor the matchmaker mulan fails that task leaving home fight her father place she may not only spare his life but bring honor too the case with most disney musicals the songs are first rate and pervasive throughout the film not sure they will get much airplay but least one the songs will doubt receive recognition come oscar time both lea salonga who provides the singing voice for mulan and donny osmond who sings for shang the captain mulan army unit and obligatory love interest are more than competent although salonga voice translates much better animation you have hear understand interestingly the musical numbers which are often done with big flourishes are surprisingly muted

1 |text let start off saying that leading the release the latest bond film really wasn looking forward much have with some the previous films not sure was the fairly lackluster trailers the ever present dread that the next film will fall back into the miserable ways the timothy dalton years happy report that any doubts were erased after about the first minutes the film that point was evident that bond was back with vengeance all doubts would have probably been erased sooner except for the fact that the first ten minutes the film weren exactly pleasant experience seems that nobody told the geniuses working the theater that the house lights are supposed turned off when the movie starts took reminder from audience member clue them guess they can excused though taking tickets and cleaning popcorn between shows extremely taxing the brain anyway after somebody remembered what the light switch was for settled for bond think the most noticeable aspect this the 19th film the series that really goes back the almost tongue cheek style the roger moore films there were probably more one liners this movie than the last several combined and bond last one liner the film about the best the series the world not enough also contained perhaps the most action any movie the series everything from wild boat chases the usual assortment cool bond gadgets trotted out just when there seems way out for 007 for the most part the action sequences worked very well although there were couple times that thought some things were bit over the top even for bond film think some the blame can laid the feet director michael apted while did good job for the most part there were points the movie specifically during action sequences that seemed loose site the fact that was making essentially action film most noticeably sequences snow covered mountain and one involving bond getting through closing door looked like apted thought was filming some sort high brow art movie almost seemed like didn know what was doing but they were brief scenes and really shouldn take away from the otherwise solid job that apted did directing you have ever seen bond film you won shocked learn that plot has never been their strong suit the world not enough exception this time have yet another over villain that bond has stop for the good the world 007 matches wits with the terrorist renard robert carlyle man who has bullet lodged his brain that makes him impervious pain why this point included beyond they took great pains explain his condition but only came later the movie scene that can only described looking like afterthought anyway renard like the typical terrorist that bent some harebrained scheme involving mid east oil pipeline guess world domination just isn attractive terrorists money making venture anymore bond brought protect the pipeline owner elektra king sophie marceau who the daughter one renard recent victims along the way bond has enlist the help nuclear scientist christmas jones denise richards and his old rival valentin zukovsky robert carlyle like all bond films you basically just have suspend disbelief over the plot since ridiculous beyond words biggest complaint would that was about the most disjointed any the bond films there was least one point that had stop and try remember why bond was where was and why was doing what was doing the buddy that saw the movie with was completely confused over earlier kidnapping marceau character was alluded earlier the movie briefly although not included the film later became big part the story and left him with the distinct feeling that had missed something but because bond film the beautiful women and nifty gadgets seem make you forget about script problems quite quickly after all isn shakespeare how about the cast brosnan seems get better with each his appearances 007 grew with the roger moore version bond really enjoyed the lighter style that brosnan brings the character judi dench had bigger role this film than her two previous appearances the role she brought the talent with her that one would expect from oscar winner robbie coltrane was easily one the best parts goldeneye was nice see his russian mobster character revived this movie coltrane gets more screen time which simply leads him stealing even more scenes then there are the bond girls sophie marceau might one the most beautiful actresses working today there just something about her breathtaking eyes that makes her natural play the innocent victim those that saw her braveheart know she more than just pretty face marceau may the most talented actress ever play bond love interest then have denise richards there was doubt mind that she was cast exclusively for her looks and after you see the outfits she wears you won have any trouble guessing what part her anatomy caught the producer eyes was pleasantly surprised find that she really did good job playing nuclear scientist admittedly there was one point that the audience snickered bit one her technical lines dialogue but other than that she stacks pun intended her bond girl predecessors nicely must say that the biggest disappointment was robert carlyle character while carlyle did fine job with the material that had his character just never worked for the producers tried very hard add more complexity his character but just never quite got off the ground guess was hoping for bit more regarding the whole impervious pain aspect his character but the writers decided play the emotional side his character this might have worked well another movie but don see bond movies for their deep characterizations last but not least have desmond llewelyn this the 17th appearance for llewelyn bond gadget guy and good ever although his screen time has grown far more limited the past few films still treat watch rumors abound that this may his last appearance the role says future appearances are higher power the producers have introduced his protege and future replacement bumbling and somewhat pompous character played comedy master john cleese while don see much him this film think fair say that desmond llewelyn legacy whenever passed will very capable hands how does stack despite some problems the world not enough very entertaining movie and all things considered what problems does have are small compared some that have plagued earlier bond movies this easily the best the brosnan films may even the best the entire series certainly the top one thing for sure even after movies there still plenty life left the james bond series here looking forward bond number
1 |text look back all the times your life when there was fork the path the future some sort decision had made and for better worse irrevocably altered the course your existence from time time everyone thinks about the roads not taken and how things might have turned out the choice had been different perhaps even more dizzying contemplate how seemingly minor action catching the train for example could have equally profound yet less obvious impact maybe that where you met your significant other and had you reached the platform just few seconds later film makers are less fascinated issues destiny than anyone else and that why there shortage movies about this subject the best the bunch were probably made the late polish director krzysztof kieslowski who was obsessed with questions fate and chance these themes weave their way through many his movies including decalogue the double life veronique and the triptych blue white and red however they are most explicitly examined 1981 film called blind chance where kieslowski presents the three different fates one man after minor action missing catching train changes the course his life his autobiography kieslowski kieslowski the director describes his attraction the concept this way the idea rich and interesting that every day faced with choice which could end our entire life yet which completely unaware while this approach has been the fodder for several notable dramatic films including way frank capra wonderful life sliding doors the first romantic comedy plumb its depths the road not taken approach isn just plot device either writer director peter howitt expands upon both possible fates character after she just misses catches train the audience watches with ever growing fascination how this one event impacts upon every aspect her life her future career where she lives whom she loves and whether she has family her separate destinies diverge and then converge she becomes two completely different individuals that woman helen played gwyneth paltrow long dark haired brit one day after losing her job advertising executive she decides return home the middle the day the scene the pivotal moment train platform scenario she just slips through the sliding doors before the train pulls out the station board she meets the cheerful talkative james john hannah monty python fan who taken with her beauty minutes later her flat she walks her lover gerry john lynch bed with another woman jeanne tripplehorn scenario she misses the train and shortly thereafter the victim attempted mugging she doesn meet james and fails make home time discover gerry infidelity juxtaposed one against the other while sharing many places cues and characters the two stories proceed parallel from there one level for viewers who enjoy pondering the workings fate sliding doors can viewed deep and wonderful experience but for those who just appreciate romantic comedy characterized solid acting script with few twists and great deal genuinely funny material sliding doors still fits the bill one its most obvious strengths that can satisfy many different types audiences those who demand something substantial from their motion pictures and those who could care less shouldn come any surprise that the acting least from three the four leads solid paltrow who does double duty two helens who are initially the same yet gradually become much different the standout she plays both her roles effectively and believably the shy insecure woman who stays with gerry and the liberated platinum blond who severs the ties her old life and embarks new career with new man john hannah known most american viewers the younger gay character four weddings and funeral instantly likable john lynch taking break from movies about ireland troubles does good job presenting gerry inept selfish philanderer only jeanne tripplehorn who plays over the top vixen seems out place her attempts broad comedy are occasionally jarring and occasionally difficult see her lydia anything more than plot element one member the supporting cast deserves special notice douglas mcferran who plays gerry best friend russell absolute delight stealing every scene that part this surely because given the best lines the movie one occasion has marvelous monologue bemoaning how advances the telecommunications industry have trapped men into life monogamy another occasion while laughing gerry plight with the women his life comments being with you makes the wait for the next episode seinfeld more bearable but not all the dialogue mcferran tears into this part with relish his performance becomes one the most memorable aspects top notch comedy this the first feature film for peter howitt and approaches the task with unimpeachable aplomb the script shrewd and inventive combining wit romance and intelligent melodrama into crowd pleasing whole sliding doors grants more than just good time the movies however for those who are inclined its central theme offers opportunity ponder some the more philosophical questions about the workings the universe all while having good time

judgement the movie until viewing its entirety that easy task superficially bears unfortunate and not necessarily unintended resemblance several other movies notably return paradise and midnight express result nearly every review brokedown palace subsequently read became hopelessly entangled making the obvious comparisons the consequence was nearly universal condemnation which shame this fine film for those who have yet view the movie let say that not attempt portray the nightmarish reality the third world criminal justice system was midnight express nor completely the moral dilemma and examination the meaning friendship and humanity that was the heart return paradise view this film compared any other source would have joseph conrad acclaimed novel lord jim problematically the basic storyline seems more than familiar two american teenage girls vacation are sentenced spend most their lives thai prison for drug smuggling obvious set involving suave con man shadowy criminal conspiracy and corrupt third world justice system the girls are alice claire danes and darlene kate beckinsale they life long buddies who planned high school graduation trip hawaii and then secretly changed their destination the more exotic thailand without telling their parents once there they find hotel and sight seeing which includes sneaking into luxury hotel sip expensive drinks poolside they get caught trying charge the bill the wrong room minor transgression which will later come back haunt them but they are saved from hotel security charming friendly australian nick daniel lapaine who takes care the bill with more polished execution the girl scam then proceeds separate the girls and make smooth moves first toward alice then toward darlene now alarm bells are going off among viewers the ever present nick too slick and his stories don add the girls course are too naive notice long before happens anticipating the inevitable disappearance the fast talking smuggler and the arrest our teenaged sitting ducks the airport route hong kong caught holding the bag literally containing heroin just predictably the thai police and courts their part meting out injustice and our trusting tourists are prison bound for long stretch left unanswered the red herring issue whether one the other the girls was willing accomplice for those need ready answer might suggest closer scrutiny the bell hop the girl fleabag hotel one door after another their comfortable former life closed the girls and their families turn desperation the noiresque expatriate lawyer fixer yankee hank bill pullam and his thai born partner wife recurring element the movie the tension between appearance and reality expressed one the film tag lines who you trust and hank exception although seasoned movie goers and those familiar with pullman oeuvre will find few surprises much the remainder the movie smorgasbord intriguing themes incompletely explored short hand fashion lou diamond phillips for instance plays delightfully sinister and callous dea agent who while appearing casually accommodating hank withholds vital information crucial moments part wider conspiracy with inherently powerful somewhat tired premise the film offers parts riveting courtroom drama prison story and potential character study american teens their relationship and what constitutes friendship between them the result reasonably engaging and suspenseful with the girls interaction hank investigation and the various trials and hearings offering hope for their release delivering tension does the foredoomed possibility their escape brokedown palace has major flaw its creators tendency like time constrained tourists take frequent side trips down fascinating alleys only reverse direction half way down and return the story main avenue and that were all there was brokedown palace wouldn very good movie but believe the writers and director were after bigger game and this they succeeded for the main theme the movie like the proffered name its location freedom all its permutations ultimately the other sub themes may considered window dressing young and pretty alice danes old soul wild streetwise teenager with thirst for freedom and adventure presented perfect blend yin and yang dark and light her cautious best friend darlene beckinsale clear eyed and straightforward alice more complex than her friend she comes from poorer background has reputation for getting into trouble and has lost the trust everyone including her own father whereas darlene life track aimed college marriage kids career suburban home middle age and fulfillment alice uncertain unfocused and yearning one poignant scene the film shows darlene shouting across open moat visitors friends and relatives from home whose lives continue while hers limbo tellingly alice present but not included just revealing their different personalities when alice and dar first come thailand the openness and delight alice face doesn read simple naivet the way she stands and stretches she and her friend ride along small boat reaching toward the sun she really drinking what she believes freedom while dar remains seated the shade brokedown palace begins with admission alice her guilt tape recording sent hank however unintentional all alice fault she responsible for persuading her friend lie her parents sneak away from the safety hawaii the perils thailand try the petty scam which places them the clutches the evil nick case one misses this point the inevitable confusion film beginning darlene obligingly reminds alice her culpability prison dar course the willing dupe which her view confers innocence never mind that was her coercion reluctant alice accompany her hong kong which placed them police custody the first place that her naive confession sealed their fate dar innocent doesn matter alice the subject this movie she and her journey toward personal freedom along the way are treated unsympathetic portrait the shallow american culture which created these girls with their half baked sensibilities and materialistic goals the end that culture like its representatives yankee hank and dar father man who knows how grease the wheels proves impotent its government the face the girl tragedy thailand culture contrary most opinion comes off much better comparison amazes that reviewers argued this point both extremes believe the filmmaker view was that thai culture vastly different from the american but not necessarily inferior the thai with the sole exceptions corrupt official and spiteful prison spy were uniformly consistent their behavior and true their principles the girls were shown treated better but certainly worse than the native born their prison stark contrast the probable reality was hellhole being relatively clean and sunlit the prison authorities demanded good hygiene provided medical care when needed and hard manual labor consisted picking grass the thai guards were authoritarian what else but certainly not routinely sadistic for the thai justice system the reasoning the thai judges during both appeal hearing and the film penultimate scene was devastating its logic and morality freedom has many faces and brokedown palace explores many them the extreme have freedom the body and freedom the spirit some settle for the former alone while others remain imprisoned with entire nation roam without the latter but freedom seldom comes without price which why the movie other tag lines are what your dream and how far would you believe could make good case for the interpretation that the person who attains freedom incarcerated not film end alice she finds redemption and salvation through the acceptance personal responsibility think the light bathing only her figure among the assembled prisoners the final scene visually signals that fact kate beckinsale character might more properly likened the released temple bird referred twice during the film trained fly back its cage the thai magistrate observed the film climactic scene the issue was always one character and the jamaican prisoner made clear that freedom achieved within oneself one thinks back over the movie which character was transformed their experiences increasingly the cinema landscape seems have become littered with endless permutations kung woman female characters virtually indistinguishable from male action figures here last the story modern heroine reading the many user comments was struck what seems unusual phenomenon whether not person liked the movie almost everyone praised the actors think about that when was the last time you came away from motion picture possibly hating but raving about all the performances yourself favor rent brokedown palace and watch with open mind there more there than meets the eye

1 |text steven spielberg amistad which based the true story group africans who revolted board slave ship then were captured and taken america where legal dispute ensued over who owned them concerned with several different aspects this story first the film addresses the issue the inherent evils slavery second deals with the historical involvement several american politicians the case including president martin van buren and former president john quincy adams anthony hopkins last and most importantly examines the cultural confusion experienced the africans who were forced into slavery and the damage done their native culture africa the slave trade amistad succeeds least partly with all three these elements have admit that was little skeptical how much could really get out another anti slavery movie having seen several other movies and documentaries about slavery doubted that there was much didn already know about fortunately turned out wrong for one thing spielberg camera never once gets near southern plantation and instead sticks the slave ships and the slave traders operations africa amistad was dealing with different part the history slavery from the very beginning and some the images here are fact much more harrowing than what usually see movies about slavery one scene the middle which the crew slave ship dispose some their excess slaves throwing them overboard drown has one the most disturbing film images the year spielberg digs farther into the evils slavery than was expecting would and fact probably goes about far movie director can without getting rating the stark suffering the africans contrasted sharply with the shallow luxury the politicians such president van buren and queen isabella spain whose naval officers were involved the legal dispute and who was only small child the time exposing politicians narrow minded opportunistic hypocrites fairly standard stuff course but spielberg and writer david franzoni well enough that still comes off something more than just simple exercise audience manipulation the film also examines the contentious nature the slavery issue the time such that john quincy adams and probably other politicians like him who clearly disapproved the practice was reluctant get involved the case until was appealed all the way the supreme court the biggest success amistad probably the characterization cinque djimon hounsou who emerges the facto leader the kidnapped africans and struggles communicate with baldwin matthew mcconaughey the lawyer who represents them court through cinque are given window into the native culture and the displaced africans try explain the prison guards what they need for proper burial dead tribe member find illustrated version the bible and try understand the story jesus christ cinque sees the dispute with clarity and simplicity that again contrasts with the technicalities and mechanics the legal process and the political squabbles what kind country this where laws almost work asks baldwin bewilderment when learns that the case must tried before the supreme court spielberg direction tends little bit towards the manipulative side times such when adds heavy orchestral swell cinque angry outburst the court room still there isn enough this for serious problem the main flaw this film which prevents from earning four stars that seems like spielberg and franzoni can quite handle all these issues the same time instead they settle for addressing each one separately and simply editing the results into the same movie this summer contact for example dealt with several issues once but each them was somehow present almost every scene and most importantly all them were resolved once amistad tries pull all together the end with speech from adams but somehow feels little forced and any case the speech itself which lasts almost fifteen minutes wears out its welcome about halfway through perhaps the best way describe this amistad three four star films edited into one almost every individual scene works but the final product lacking the necessary focus and coherence and thus less than the sum its parts however can honestly say how could have been done differently and any case the story comes through with enough raw emotional power that still very good film and thus recommend anyone who can handle the disturbing imagery

1 |text with the success the surprise hit alien directed ridley scott sequel was inevitable fact after watching the first film sequel was wanted particularly this reviewer handing over the director chair recent box office gem james cameron who had only made two films previous this one pirahna surprisingly dull film and terminator making cameron household name the alien series got face lift immense proportions instead being suspense science fiction film cameron alters the series and changing into action picture what results one the most terrifying films ever created film like aliens comes along only once while and when does audiences are usually unprepared for never saw this movie theaters but wish could have the terror and fright must have been unimaginable most likely with audiences members literally shrieking fear aliens action film unlike any have ever seen with science fiction plot cameron gives aliens added testosterone pumping the action and fire power from the original film fact aliens one those few sequels which tops the original perhaps what makes the alien series impressive the hero heroine the case may never have had more sympathetic hero action film and never have seen such impressive acting job done the main character sigourney weaver possibly the only actress who could play this character and make her realistic enough for care about placing woman these situations would sometimes seem unusual but because weaver presence woman the only suitable hero aliens begins years after alien ended lieutenant ellen ripley weaver discovered hypersleep the nostromo and awakened she explains how she the only survivor her past encounter with the aliens but the company doubtful they explain that colony families flourishing the same planet from which she just left despite stern warnings from ripley the company remains rigid and won call the families back however when the company loses contact with the colony ripley story seems much more feasible one the company directors carter burke paul reiser wants gather team travel the planet this team includes buff private vasquez jenette goldstein questionable corporal hicks michael biehn and loyal android bishop lance henriksen burke tags along with ripley they fly the planet order locate the members the colony arriving the planet the team finds most the human life extinguished cocoon type environment the only survivor year old rebecca newt jorden carrie henn ripley finds this chance the mother she never had the opportunity become and she becomes newt surrogate mother ripley and newt are the only ones who knows what has happened and soon all hell breaks loose aliens not only multiplies the thrills and suspense from scott version also multiplies the number aliens general alien focused one alien particular which systematically killed each crew member except ripley who managed jettison the alien out the nostromo aliens focuses entire race these aliens and result the chills are incredibly heightened then again this james cameron the guy who has given true lies and terminator judgment day the best action director out there topping renny harlin who directed cliffhanger and only could create something terrifying this film seems that every alien film seems have some memorable scene scenes and aliens has the motherload with perhaps one the most astonishing endings ever created for action film aliens climax never seems hit until the viewer nearly pushed extreme exhaustion can recall another film ever sustain this level intensity throughout never dropping for moment just when you think the movie over something else will occur and starts right back again with seemingly endless conclusion aliens ends with one the greatest moments film history this scene usually the one remembered most from the film lieutenant ripley steps into one the lifting machines fight the alien queen using flawless special effects the climax exhausting leaving any audience member drained from extreme anxiety course for film this genre work properly the technical aspects must realistic enough for believe what see aliens completely realistic even decade after its initial release the special effects are wonderfully seamless with terrifying alien with them one the most overlooked aspects this film the music composed cameron regular james horner horner has created terrific score receiving oscar nomination for his work not only that horner has also created one the best scores for any action film science fiction film ever and that includes 2001 space odyssey which was mainly compilation well known composers fact the climax music also some the most recognized film music the production design incredible which also happened snag nomination from the academy dark corridors lit red lights are very impressive but more impressive the amount terror which arises from well lit locations normally film will very dark order scare viewer aliens uses lights scare the viewer then course the cinematography which uses point view shots along with video feeds order build suspense some the scariest scenes involve the perspective ripley surprisingly the acting not only above average for this genre but some the best sigourney weaver received oscar nomination for her portrayal ripley incorporating the right amount sympathy into her hard edged persona weaver soars above the rest this film but she supposed carrie henn gives above average performance for child developing three dimensional character from her quiet attitude lance henriksen terrific bishop showing that androids don always have flat characters jenette goldstein shows fair amount enthusiasm with her role and steals several scenes her own though her personality becomes slightly annoying when she isn fighting michael biehn gives very nice performance the most obligatory role the film however biehn does good job making seem original again paul reiser may seem like odd choice play the sleazy corporate director but reiser manages pull off quite well however still see him paul mad about you very good cast which also includes bill paxton and william hope highlights this action film making stand out from others aliens rightfully rated for violence gore language and terror aliens sort the redefining moment the science fiction genre alien was more suspense horror film aliens pumps the stakes and cameron directs with professional quality cameron certainly knows how make good action film but here proves how can create some truly horrific moments screen technically astonishing aliens only flaw small characters who are only there get killed aside from this you probably won experience anything like aliens for quite while

screen right front admit that don know what the heck talking about but here goes titanic the gone with the wind the 1990 maybe that going little bit too far good job leonardo dicaprio and kate winslet this movie they clark gable and vivien leigh but the parallels are there gwtw was the first movie take real advantage the most revolutionary technology available technicolor titanic takes revolutionary steps forward seamlessly integrating computer graphic design with actors gwtw places america greatest tragedy the background classic love story titanic does the same with the atlantic most legendary tragedy they both have strong willed redheaded heroines they both exploit the class differences between the aristocracy and the slaves steerage bums they were both incredibly expensive and popular maybe that not enough parallels titanic not gwtw league matter titanic great movie its own right complete with spills thrills and especially chills much has been made the humongous cost the production and all the care than went into making the huge luxury liner come alive again the money was obviously well spent the costumes look great the sets look great the cgi graphics look great especially liked the expensive little touches like spending tons money authentic titanic china only break all the floor the ship sinks but writer director producer james cameron real challenge writing directing producing titanic wasn just costuming and set design and special effects cameron major headache was keeping the audience interested tale where everybody knows the ending going succeeds masterfully cameron does two things that work incredibly well first shows modern day salvage operations titanic that just titanic not the titanic mind you the first glimpse get titanic the ship its present state corroding slowly away under the hammering pressure the north atlantic from the window minisub piloted treasure hunter brock lovett bill paxton television coverage the exploration titanic intrigues 101 year old rose calvert gloria stuart who survived the wreck 1912 stuart does phenomenal job brief role narrating the story her experience stunned paxton and his roughneck crew secondly

young artist jack daswon dicaprio the way that big budget disaster movies usually wrong have all star cast see the impact the disaster wide group people cameron wisely chooses stick with rose and jack while paying scant heed the celebrities board the supporting cast professional but mostly anonymous other than kathy bates the unsinkable molly brown there moment when you stop and say yeah know him what been although would like have seen colm meaney white star uniform even the ill fated engineer the love story itself rather conventional think some reviewers found weak and that may fair criticism the performances are the key here zane has the meatiest part the movie and plays the arrogant condescending steel millionaire the hilt smooth looks great tuxedo and convincing enough jerk that the winslet dicaprio relationship looks plausible the moment when sees little girl too frightened get aboard lifeboat you can hear the wheels his mind turning saying not can save this little girl but can she help get lifeboat dicaprio revelation hadn seen him before anything and didn know what the heck expect really honestly expected bad irish accent but cameron evidently decided that was bad idea dicaprio plays poor american artist who wins ticket poker game dicaprio exhibits infectious joy being alive and being the titanic that hard not like him from the moment that the ship leaves port until hits the iceberg dicaprio has carry the movie and keep our interest and never falters winslet character grows lot during the movie and does her performance first she not required anything but wear period clothing and look drop dead gorgeous know from the narration that she monstrously unhappy with her arranged marriage zane but there isn any expression these feelings until she encounters dicaprio winslet and dicaprio develop chemistry that manages propel the movie along until the ship hits the iceberg that moment where winslet character really comes alive faced with real danger she drops her spoiled rich girl mannerisms and does splendid job rose and jack race around the doomed ship looking for shelter from the freezing water and cal fiery temper winslet turns superb acting performance mixing courage and compassion and anger with sheer shrieking terror course the most interesting character the ship itself cameron has clearly fallen love with titanic and shows her every mood deserted wreck down the boiler room the bridge down the hold the captain table down steerage and manages bring the great ship back from the dead cameron greatest gift that allows fall love with

prominent drama critics england the play was successful that the film rights were immediately snapped and production the film began mere year later october 1974 the film version now titled the rocky horror picture show was released 1975 and immediately tanked the box office whether was because fox wasn quite sure how market audiences that audiences didn quite know what make themselves has never really been determined but the one common bit knowledge about the film was that was huge flop seemed that the infectious spirit brought about the stage version had not been infused into the film version and fox quickly had pulled from theaters year later something entirely strange and magical happened prints the film started distributed theaters small amounts and were circulating midnight

they will ingrained your head for all eternity goes without saying that the time warp the most popular song the film even people who have never seen the movie know that particular song what those who

1 |text terribly unfortunate that stir echoes tautly written and directed david koepp who made one 1996 unsung treasures the trigger effect should released little more than month after the sixth sense which still going strong the box office these two films are undoubtedly going compared judging from practically all fellow audience members last night and although they have eerily similar storylines stir echoes more straightforward psychological horror film while the sixth sense closer psychological drama additionally while the sixth sense had shocker ending that undoubtedly has been one the major factors its recent repeat business stir echoes more conventional and predictable its final twist and where the sixth sense was disturbing stir echoes just plain scary have feeling most viewers are going come away unimpressed because the unavoidable similarities and will foolishly forget judge this film its own respectable merits adapted from novel richard matheson that was written some forty years ago stir echoes opens with cute six year old boy named jake zachary david cope who taking bath speaking directly the screen but immediately have feeling someone else there finally asks does hurt dead apparently jake sees the ghosts dead people but unlike the sixth sense this young child isn the focus the picture instead tom witzy kevin bacon chicago lineman our protagonist jake his son and maggie kathryn erbe whom has just discovered she six weeks pregnant his hard working wife one night while party with their closest friends tom convinces maggie new age sister lisa illena douglas try and hypnotize him unexpectedly works and before long tom seeing things wouldn normally see including deceased teenage girl jenny morrison his house who happens have been missing for the last six months seeking help from lisa she tells him that while was under hypnosis she told him that after awoke his mind will remain clear and free like opened door she didn expect work but did and the only way stop for tom somehow find way help this girl sees stir echoes isn perfect film any stretch the imagination but the thick atmospheric mood conjures terrifically eerie domestic horror drama and not only effective technical level but impressive its portrayal struggling working class family kevin bacon and especially kathryn erbe 1997 dream with the fishes are top notch and exceedingly believable loving married couple who nonetheless have their fair share problems after tom hypnotized and starts seeing ghastly visions completely taken over his desire solve this mystery the disappearing girl whom has seen lurking his house and instead maggie not being understanding she instead believes what tom says and aside from being little worried what going through does not try stop his pursuit bacon and erbe are not traditional hollywood stars like tom cruise and julia roberts and therefore are easier relate and always plausible struggling couple who have work overtime their jobs just make ends meet masterfully done entrancing sequence tom hypnotized lisa but instead watching him instead see what sees starting from his view closes his eyes into darkness lisa tells him visualize being empty movie theater and audience members are watching movie screen from inside theater which also showing movie screen theater telling him move closer and closer the screen fuzzy word black letters pops the screen begin float closer and closer the front the theater until see that the word sleep never before have seen hypnotism scene mesmerizing and brilliantly construed this one truthfully this set piece and another which tom wakes from nightmarish dream only quickly discover reliving what has just dreamt are worth the full price admission alone just see them the big screen having loads fun with her small role maggie sister lisa illeana douglas 1995 die for her last great character delight but rarely used her full advantage feature films funny and enjoyably offbeat douglas gets utter the best line the film while talking maggie about tom visions the girl she remarks wouldn worried about him seeing another girl although the fact that she dead gives one pause also note are jenny morrison 1994 intersection who truly poignant the last half the film when flash back see what really happened her missing character and liza weil remarkable 1998 whatever morrison grieving teenage sister debbie the resolution stir echoes does not live its obviously frightful full potential and doesn what comes before both involving and appropriately gritty the music score james newton howard and unsettling use whispers and ghostly sound effects successfully compliment and foreshadow the off kilter frame mind that tom put into and director david koepp proves once again that director with knack for creating almost unbearably tense situations that revolve around realistically written characters stir echoes isn good the sixth sense but why should need both films are fully

each lasting about five minutes vegas vacation comes off like the first good example the latter would last year black sheep the problem with this format that becomes old fast and doesn really fit into movie mold these cases plot which generally very thin used either shameless filler between scenes simply add convenience the gags have good vegas joke make vegas movie such the case with this movie mini plots clark gets gambling fever and begins spending all the griswold money ellen the verge affair with wayne newton rusty has fake and using his gambling advantage and audrey desperate for fun and winds joining her cousin vickie shae lyn exotic dancer the simple fact this movie isn funny first did find myself chuckling heartily couple little jokes but when the movie got rolling interest suddenly stopped chase plays clark griswold really well made the character and the character angelo quite honest never was too impressive ellen and this movie doesn show any signs redemption for the two new griswold kids the word blah comes mind the vacation series seems out prove that anybody can play these two characters the simple reason being that there nothing them they generic you expect the credits read girl audrey griswold vegas vacation differs from the first three the series more than just laugh factor yes true that vegas vacation isn even close being close being funny the others which were actually pretty fun their own doofy ways but there are couple other things that set this one negatively apart first off why did they leave off the national lampoon heading the title couldn find any reasons why but maybe the fact even national lampoon didn want associated with such lame film that saying lot especially when you look what else the company has proudly presented loaded weapon pcu etc they expected this another hit you would assume they proud tack the notorious header but for reasons only can guess like the movie sucking they didn there another difference here that makes obvious impact the first three films the vacation series were written john hughes talented writer who behind several popular films the including mom sixteen candles the breakfast club weird science pretty pink ferris bueller day off planes trains and automobiles and uncle buck wowzers what sum looking the names you think this guy wrote everything that now stands movie icon for the 1980 well that not all this guy also brought hits including the home alone series the remake 101 dalmatians dennis the menace and the current flubber vegas vacation however didn have john hughes behind and the loss very obvious this time around the script the hands elisa bell whose only credits thus far include four made for movies vegas vacation plays very much like one and would actually work much better made for sequel this sounds like wild idea not revenge the nerds third and fourth installments were both television movies and they seemed like vegas vacation would fit well the fox network sunday morning movie but silver screen major motion picture quite out place stephen kessler jejune direction doesn help things either only makes the film even more movie ish each consecutive vacation movie has suffered drop directing power started the series off with harold ramis who also directed caddyshack and groundhog day well writing ghostbusters not too bad then had national lampoon european vacation being directed amy heckerling who would direct the hits look who talking and clueless well having already directed the infamous fast times ridgemont high lastly had national lampoon christmas vacation directed jeremiah chechik who went direct the charming benny joon kessler far has one title under his belt the short film birch street gym which received oscar nomination 1992 granted that this was his first attempt feature length film can allow for some amateurish quality but instead get movie straight from the text book boring bland and deeply unoriginal you loved the vacation movies and know some did there still isn anything here worth seeing you loved them don ruin your good impressions the series indulging this tragic example cinema ala carte you never did like the series why the need confirm why
1 |text love the devil challenging film munundating its audience with wild imagery and plot structure that disallows plot perhaps attempt get know the artist psyche rather than the artist lifeline watching was enthralled with the look the film the way the director shot everything like was looking through bizarre personalized filter everything looks like not how life looks like but how painter francis bacon the film subject looked personally but while was engrossed stumbled upon thoughts halfway through the film awakened from trance some inner distraction and began try and follow what going exactly what was looking watching this film wasn sure was the most insightful film had ever seen the most vacuous directed and written john maybury love the devil stylish masterpiece for the senses everything looks originally bizarre and perplexing the camera angles are ferociously askew and the close ups are uncomfortably too close the editing deft occasionally cutting away something bizarre every couple seconds but other times holding shot for long that you wonder the audience not supposed voyeurs rather intruders bacon world and psyche such there real story not heard much about francis bacon that didn read prior the film but what learned was this was painter england who reached his peak during the 60s and 70s drawing hideously bizarre drawings carnage and the like was one the first really come out the closet and interviews was notoriously drunk yet incredibly witty played great shakesperean actor derek jacobi like foppish and self absorbed cross between oscar wilde and nero lives life the way wants live the disatisfaction those who have the privelege being really close him were taking delight the destruction others and maybe himself champagne for real friends and pain for sham friends says one night the bar frequents love the devil chronicles the latter part his life bacon well known his mid life awakens one night when hears man tumble through his ceiling window and land the floor walks unafraid what finds and discovers thief george dyer daniel craig bacon gives him offer spends the night with him can take anything wants the morning george agrees this and off bed goes but ends staying with him for whatever reason the film shows their lives together least reference one another while creating bacon world friends like high art this film minors showing certain group people who radiate connection that not shown but understood the film shows the relationship bacon and george remains rather stagnant bacon haughty and bizarre george simple and doesn understand bacon the least especially not his paintings while watching this that basically all thought was there the film has hypnotic feel free any restraints form and shot uniquely that felt attention was almost entirely the way this film was made rather than what about once the film over easier piece together kept thinking about this film wondering what the point all was someone doesn merely make film all style and substance all and they they accident but still allow some substance creep thinking about remembered how the two fed off eachother thought about how bacon was masochist love with cruelty one scene watches boxing match with orgiastic delight and lets out squeal pleasure when blood from the one boxer head splashes across his face another scene masturbates the odessa steps sequence eisenstein battleship potemkin and perhaps drove george too far his delight for pain drove him over the edge and for him that was love even wasn for george guess that explains the title bit that great and all but almost wish the film was devoid any meaning wish hadn reduced itself making some point about humanity about how love the most selfish thing the world and you look certain way maybe had avoided any meaning about humanity and merely drove itself into being the one film that was truly inside one man twisted pysche almost always best obtain insights from looking one man uniqueness than forcing universality down audience throat that way you don reduce your film something just not can say totally enjoyed love the devil though despite all the things respect about this movie still rather uncomfortable sit through even normally trite length ninety minutes the film still seems like arduous task sit through especially after exhausting first hour though hypnotic still almost seems gimmicky and even redundant times were taking advantage one man truly bizarre nature but not doing anything deeper with such respect the way the film looks beautiful and painstakingly crafted that along with what dreams may come and dark city the year most visually stunning film fact better script had been forged almost compare visual power peter greenaway film complete with similar haunting images that stick the mind forever and with dymanite performance derek jacobi has the comic and distanced tone that needs just wish had been more than mostly style and just hair bit substance then would have had something hold over even now

waiting waiting for this movie ever since the end credits return the jedi started roll you see the trilogy not just set movies but religion sorts the faithful disciples and the phantom menace tantamount the second coming the messiah unfortunately not our savior for weeks beforehand was going around telling people that this movie had better damned good stupendously good miraculously good anything less and the biggest disappointment the century didn want the doomsaying prophecy come true really didn but this film nevertheless fails reach the pinnacles filmmaking character development virtually nonexistent with the possible exception qui gon most the film characters seem left with nothing but through the motions none seem very affected their experiences and few even show any

deep doo doo and even manages step some the same while walking around mos eisley spaceport therein lies key difference between this film and one its predecessors star wars had obi wan telling mos eisley was wretched hive scum and villainy the phantom menace get doo doo the films the trilogy took away from everyday life and immersed story long time ago galaxy far far away this film the other hand constantly reminds that only movie including situations and phrases that are uniquely modern american that they seem incredibly out place and serve jerk the viewer from the experience perhaps the most blatant offense occurs during scene where young anakin skywalker enters into pod racing competition kind like chariot racing with large engines instead horses and there are couple commentators press box delivering indy 500 like play play liked the pod race was really exciting and ratcheted the tension but when the heck did lucas think the idea putting the sportscasters the race would have been even more exciting without the distraction this aspect coupled with the emphasis humor simply baffled suppose one may say that lucas was trying appeal the younger viewer but would more intelligent scenes and dialog hurt this appeal all didn millions youngsters still back see the original star wars 1977 over and over again didn the action figures still sell like hotcakes course they did and only poor judgment that allows the most eagerly awaited film history marred pandering children who would still have enjoyed film with more appeal for adults one aspect that will appeal broadly however the use special effects the people lucas industrial light and magic the world premiere effects house outdid themselves providing seamless integration computer generated images and real life footage some the scenes have seen believed especially the shots land battle between the federation robot army and jar jar countrymen the space battles are also impressive although improved over past efforts only subtle margins the casual observer this however testament the work which ilm produced two decades ago and still holds well today john williams back course providing score for the film only can his music pervasive throughout rousing and dramatic ever always serving punctuate scenes noticeably and appropriately since this film supposed the first installment nine episode story star wars the empire strikes back and return the jedi being episodes four five and six respectively the phantom menace has the daunting task setting the origins several characters know already addition those with whom unfamiliar result attention history and characterization was spread little thin would have been nice get more depth with yoda and obi wan for example but given the fact that there were several new characters cover understandable that some the development has been left for the next two films one the new characters darth maul hailed the new villain with much hype marketing forces could muster prior this film release spite the hype darth maul character which almost didn have the film his role insignificant has maybe three spoken lines believe not second actor voices the character and the rest the time just scowls and looks mean with that working against him never has chance being interesting and instead ends utter disappointment lucas seems have wanted develop the spiritual nature the star wars universe something which has been prominent throughout however does largely paralleling the star wars spirituality with the bible offering easy out for story writing and once again bringing the viewer back planet earth with real life connection oddly while trying capitalize spirituality lucas the same time introduces the fact that mastery the force dependent upon having little force loving parasites your body cells this only serves mystify the workings the force few notches offering scientific connection don let mislead you too far the phantom menace most standards good film contains lot visual treats sets the stage for epic story gives bit excitement here and there and even allows revisit some our old friends just that when held predecessors and not would unrealistic this film simply pales

the audience with whom saw this film was reacting the same way realized that was going have hard time finding someone who agrees with about the quality the picture you see patch adams revolted beyond all boundaries hated this movie for every second that sat watching and actively hate now days later with the simpering superficial nauseatingly sentimental images forever plaguing memories hate every element the film beginning with tom shadyac shameless direction and all the way the misguided and mishandled themes that the screenplay wants desperately convey the badness patch adams stupefying confounding can believe film can this bad and yet based real man who probably has good point make the film patch played the undefeatable and indefatigable robin williams performance such insulting pathos and sledgehammer sympathy that wonder now even human the beginning the film patch commits himself mental institution because doesn want kill himself while there notices that the doctors don care about the patients and that the best way get through the patients treat them like human beings patch goes crusade great doctor who actually talks his patients goes medical school where meets truman daniel london and convinces him that good help people also meets carin fischer monica potters the anti male med student who just wants through the motions and successful doctor naturally the dean the medical school bob gunton hates patch and wants thwart his plans even though patch gets the highest scores all his exams patch decides that going build free clinic the middle nowhere help people with any problem they may have and that friends the synopsis for what easily the most abhorrent picture 1998 superficial level the film not particularly bad wouldn say the cinematography bothered and most the performances seem exactly what shadyac was aiming for actually liked potter performance even she wasted but the film fails fundamentally execution every scene swells with grand emotional music played maximum volume just get all cry real hard take for instance the first scene which shows patch sitting bus don know patch yet but there sad music and supposed make really sad that sad later patch makes lot progress helps dying patient peter coyote enjoy the last days his life and the music patch pushing the patient recklessly through the halls the hospital very lively and when that patient finally dies spoiler alert the music very very sad but the problem with all this that the music should not the center the emotions real drama character based you grow like someone and then something bad happens and you feel don ever grow know the dying patient simply vehicle for patch greatness real drama doesn seem forced present just make the audience cry that why patch adams not real drama goes for every cheap tear imaginable wringing tired and overbearing sentimentality out every scene even scenes that have very little impact the overall film are drowning marc shaiman sickening musical score sentimentality like this indeed bad but not bad half baked simplistic themes you see patch really great student aces his tests without studying and does effectively that people think cheating but patch doesn think that memorizing facts the way become good doctor why don see patients until the third year bursts out every three seconds well patch that might have something with the fact that you need learn something before you treating patients not everyone has the capability memorizing facts with effort most have study and doctor who really wants help but doesn know toe from finger probably won too successful preventing death wait almost forgot the point doctors not just prevent death but improve the quality life yes that true and you can not that without studying you can not that without going medical school what patch never seemed understand was the possibility that maybe just maybe good idea study first and talk patients later follow the rules bah who needs the rules only uptight doctors follow the rules the real saviors are the ones running around the hospitals with big red spheres their faces and sporting baggy yellow pants and then there the free clinic issue which find shockingly frighteningly idealistic free clinic the middle the forest where patients can taken helped for free how will patients transported the free clinic will have emergency room just for mental patients and who may ask will pay for the film does give some token attempts question patch motives think another character asks him how going pay for addition little bit meaningless blather about hmos and medical insurance but they certainly don explore challenge patch ideas any meaningful extent reader please understand this not making any kind judgment the real patch adams know nothing about him his beliefs mirror those this film character then might like have intelligent discussion with him about them but regardless what the real patch adams believes the themes put forth this film are simplistic and phony and the last scene the big obligatory courtroom scene that forced lunch halfway esophagus patch does lot shouting actually robin williams does lot shouting shouts lot about helping people and lot people cry because they are moved his words won tell you that you can moved his words because too was moved his words was moved such profoundly negative way that was reminded how cheap and phony cinematic experience can patch adams the cheapest them all

-1 |text capsule the much anticipated adaptation the pierre boulle novel comes the screen dark and little dreary film with lots chases and fighting but very little intelligence visually there much like about this version but the approach take adventure after the style gulliver travels and treat action film that makes film without much center pierre boulle author the bridge the river kwai wrote planet the apes monkey planet the novel social satire reads lot like fifth book gulliver travels humans discover planet which the roles apes and humans have been reversed not unlike the roles horses and humans jonathan swift island the houyhnhnms the novel moves somewhat slowly create some suspense revealing all the things most film fans know true about the nature the planet seems there also statement about human cruelty animals but perhaps was just looking for that when rod serling adapted the novel into film released 1968 added number serling touches familiar from episodes the twilight zone and changed the ending make more serling ish the final irony the original version has become film history without there could never have been planet the apes film series can surmise only that serling ran into serious script problems how handle the tricky question language the book the apes had their own language and the human eventually learned that language that could have been done the film but that would have required the entire film subtitled for the non ape speaking serling avoided this having the apes speak english and course there some justification for that the end the film justifying why the apes spoke english may have even been the inspiration for his surprise ending but serling never tackles the all important question why supposedly intelligent human never shows any curiosity even surprise that the apes speak his own language language they had opportunity ever hear few viewers questioned this serious plot hole however and the film has become well respected cinema history partial credit least should jerry goldsmith whose extremely inventive score one goldsmith best not his best when the film success called for sequels the filmmakers turned the violence and they added well intentioned though not very subtle political messages about what was happening the united states the 1960s and 1970s while the first film had little shooting guns and what was there seemed little half hearted the second film beneath the planet the apes there was good deal more violence and from that point the series had lot violence and chases the series concluded with battle for the planet the apes 1973 now director tim burton tries his hand adapting the original book again for those who thought that the 1968 version was not very faithful the book burton new version even less faithful first does not really reverse the roles the humans and the apes has them both intelligent articulate races battling for dominance the planet currently the hands make that paws the apes that could good story too but not planet the apes with the mission impossible films and many other cinematic homages the third quarter the last century the title makes promises that the filmmakers have intention honoring 2029 leo davidson mark wahlberg not this world most expressive actor works space station increasing the intelligence and usefulness apes then convenient time storm sweeps him wizard fashion and drops him alien planet yes survives this storm but then storm perfect quickly finds not greatly any surprise shows that this planet apes rule and humans drool but everybody talks and the language they talk earth english apparently does not even occur leo that there mystery that needs explained about that the fact does not occur leo and apparently didn occur tim burton either the heart the real horror this film both just assumed that apes were going talk the language they would speak would english any case having one talking race dominating another makes this not look human animal relationships and more one the master slave relationships outside sudan and few other countries this less relevant topic leo captured used slave but also discovered ari played helena bonham carter ari attractive ape with close ties high political power she bent making the world better place perhaps previous draft the script she was called hil ari any case with makeup that stifles her usual pout carter just about attractive she has ever been film she may want consider this become her standard look from this point forward not long before leo escapes with some human and only couple sympathetic apes this further abandonment the source material the chase severely limits the interplay ape and human and the examination each place this reversed society each important the book cannot see how the society works because most the screentime society has broken down see the humans either separated from the apes fighting them burton chooses visceral thrills over cerebral ones almost every turn this miscalculation characters lacking empathy value are difficult ones place much emotional investment they are basically chess pieces and the viewer has little reason root for them win the 1968 script had little subtlety with lines like never met ape didn like but least cared for what happened taylor the main character most what this film has offer the visuals the visual work spotty but generally nicely done except that much the film takes place the night fog this tends limit close looks the makeup general seems much improved from 1968 the makeup team led rick baker instead john chambers who did for the 1968 version 1968 chambers makeup was jaw dropper was realistic enough almost believable but flexible enough show emotion chambers good but anyone had chance best him would have baker today audiences have higher expectations baker visualization really improvement these visuals work nicely what does not work the wire assisted leaps some the apes make they look like they were inspired the physics defying leaps crouching tiger hidden dragon apes spring incredible distances some the best scenes are apes running into battle looking like they have ape posture but when they start flying through the air the effect lost one final visual problem that the film frequently shows its budget what should spectacular battle scenes the camera shows only small group people close since the days lon chaney and boris karloff few actors have crossed over stardom role that required heavy make the one actor who has shot paul giamatti not that his lines are good most are silly jokes but delivers them very well was always watchable actor but has not yet made stardom the ape trader limbo over emotes overcome his ape make but does very well doing makes himself the most interesting thing the screen probably the best thing the film and conjures memories peter ustinov performance spartacus joke there are several lines the script borrowed from the 1968 film and old ape played charleton heston becomes allusion the first film itself danny elfman score has nice primitive feel but jerry goldsmith 1968 tour force score real classic that score and the whole film will remembered when the 2001 film forgotten rate the remake the scale and the scale
-1 |text there should requirement that potential viewer under certain film order see mission mars there are probably quite few people who are going enjoy and most them will probably those who have seen very few films its kind but there are those who will not and those will most likely people who have already seen one more the following movies 2001 space odyssey armageddon apollo the abyss close encounters the third kind the extra terrestrial alien and aliens why because there not one original idea mission mars all cribbed from other films and most cases better films this the sort thing you don mind you might like the film course there are other reasons not like mission mars the main one being script written people who seem assume their audience filled with people who haven used their brains some time and who don intend start during the film running time mission mars manages both stupid and boring the same time the plot cribbed greatly from 2001 concerns team sent mars the first manned trip ever made the red planet luke graham don cheadle leads the team jointly formed americans and russians the team encounters mysterious monolith that emits strange pulse this being nothing like the pulse emitting monolith 2001 that one was the moon but when they try study giant sand tornado comes out the top and swallows them all except luke who survives long enough send garbled message back the rotating space station which looks strangely like the rotating space station 2001 rescue mission planned with husband wife team woody blake tim robbins and terri fisher connie nielsen obligatory pilot with troubled past jim mcconnell gary sinise and extra crew member phil ohlmyer jerry connell along for the ride after some zero gravity dancing they run into problems when one their engines blown forcing them attempt desperate landing aboard supply vessel now stranded mars with minimal supplies the team must decide whether not can risk entering the monolith they should return home after all that monolith just might contain information about how life originated earth mission mars one those films that makes critic wonder where start when talking about all the things that are wrong with let start with one the things that does work director brian palma manages create some eerie tension few scenes during the middle the film that everything else fails the failure isn palma fault working from atrocious script only during the sequence aboard the ship looking awful lot like the jupiter vessel 2001 where the rescue team air begins running out and they must frantically search for the hole and patch does mission mars come life scene where they attempt save comrade floating away into space also provides some tension until you realize that the entire danger more danger attempted rescue sequence has absolutely nothing with the rest the film just contrived way generate thrilling scenes take out and the plot isn affected any way the sequence also suffers from few plot holes does the rest the film why the ship computer which sounds strangely like hal from 2001 able detect hole the main chamber but not one the engine why did tim robbins character have outside the ship when the solution easily presented itself from inside shouldn the astronauts better trained deal with hull breach why are the characters such idiots because the script makes little attempt properly develop them all the conflict clumsily delivered excruciatingly obvious exposition the opening scene which rips off orson welles and robert altman utilizing long opening tracking shot during which the characters repeatedly tell each other about things all them should already know jim too bad you can this mission because you were determined psychologically inadequate because your wife died right before you were the mission together does anyone really talk like this can find out these things less grating matter like maybe flashback the whole film like that the filmmakers are not content merely show something and assume know what going they must tell exactly what looking every time sample dialogue from the film shot mars astronaut look there mars astronaut you sure that mars astronaut yeah that mars all right astronaut hey are you guys looking mars that exchange isn actually mission mars but wouldn surprised were for all their cribbing from kubrick spielberg james cameron and even ron howard the makers this film haven learned something all those directors did very well show and don tell palma used know how but seems have forgotten this mentally challenged filmmaking they assume the audience won get what going they explain everything five times over fourth graders may appreciate this but more learned viewers will have their intelligence insulted the principal actors sleepwalk their way through mission mars never managing away with apparent just here get paycheck attitude cheadle stumbles over his awkward lines armin mueller stahl manages thoroughly embarrass himself unbilled cameo robbins puts his game face and phones his standard decent guy performance and sinise hams with wistful facial expressions while watching tapes his dead wife played kim delaney who only has one scene during which she still manages deliver some ridiculous dialogue heavy handed monologue about the meaning life and especially during the stolen from less than three movies lollipop whoever names them conclusion which combines endless obvious explanation and sub par cgi effects with gagging sentimentality and sure alienate any viewers who had been enjoying the show until then and course these aliens from mars who facilitated the evolution life earth are entirely different from the aliens 2001 who facilitated the evolution life earth those aliens were from unknown world could said that fans brainless action films might enjoy mission mars but such comment ignores the fact that the film also incredibly slow going leisurely pacing might have helped film with little more substance but all the substance mission mars has been stolen from other films and those other films dealt with their ideas much more thoughtful fashion and generally contained more engaging characters supposedly intended choke when one character decides not return home the end this one totally different from the one character decides not return ending armageddon but suspect most people will either laughing groaning alternated between the two there only one good thing about the way mission mars finally ends the fact that the movie over

1 |text before you read review you gotta know that love woody allen this very important note because allen films are generally acquired taste and definitely not for everyone know folks who believe him complete genius while others see him dirty schnook who keeps making the same movie over and over again love most his films but will admit having been quite disappointed his recent crop during the 90s fact why felt the need make movies those years beyond you look the quality those films you hear what saying the only two films his that really liked during that time were bullets over broadway and husbands and wives fact secretly hoped that would take some time off the turn the millennium just energize something but doesn appear though has any intention doing that here again reviewing yet another woody allen movie and hoping that brings back the woody from the days old plot the year 1940 and woody allen top notch insurance investigator his methods are very old fashioned and apparently out date new employee hunt has just been hired streamline the operations for greater efficiency the two not like each other one night they are both put under hypnotic trance magician and unbeknownst them placed under his control soon thereafter jewels are stolen words love are exchanged and everyone looking for answer critique wonderful recreation the 1940s style movies with the fast talking witty banter between workers catchy jazz score moving things along film noirish elements such the veronica lake type sexpot one liners galore and fluffy inconsequential plotline the downside the film actually starts off pretty slowly with the first hour tossing only few guffaws out there but never really generating any kind steady flow energy the sets the other hand were amazing the production design and costumes were perfect and the casting ideal kept hoping that the film would pick and not turn into yet another mediocre outing for the man but wasn not long before was fully engaged the characters entertained the many zingers delivered back and forth between allen and hunt and actually interested the resolution the flick also appreciated how allen played the fine line between homage the films old parody and actual reinvention note theron entire female persona that drenched film noir very cool course films like this with little real tension the plot need solid actors keep you interested the quick fire dialogue and once again allen does great job playing his character who for once isn his typical new york jewish neurotic cheating insecure husband dude actually plays macho guy here and handles pretty well especially the scenes which hypnotized but the bigger surprise for this film was helen hunt actress who was openly sick seeing movies late last year sorry babe you were just too many the same time anyway she really great this film the headstrong woman looking new era equality amongst men and doesn miss beat allen fast paced dialogue didn care much for her running joke about him dying whenever left room but overall she was really good and especially liked the way that her sweaters clung her breasts they did yum yum harumph but digress let recap great looking picture with nice jazzy score some funny one liners especially the second half decent plotline although you shouldn expect real mystery anything and some solid acting all around can say that this even remotely close any allen best work but certainly believe step the right direction especially after the dinky decade films that just went through probably better geared towards allen fans more than anyone else but would still recommend this film anyone looking for cute old school kind vibe with chemistry between the leads zippy dialogue and satisfying conclusion little known facts about this film and its stars annie hall celebrity everyone says love you husbands and wives mighty aphrodite small time crooks when harry met sally you got mail

-1 |text godzilla the ultimate culmination the who cares about plot summer movie loose remake the 1954 classic japanese monster movie godzilla king the monsters which itself pretty thin the story department roland emmerich and dean devlin big budget lizard stomps manhattan disaster flick has been written with the brain dead mind the script isn just dumbed down lobotomized godzilla lives and dies special effects alone presumably the primary target group for this film teenage boys the demographic most likely shell out repeatedly see the same images monster instigated carnage that not say that females and other age groups are immune the special effects seduction they just not readily susceptible this the third straight movie row where emmerich and devlin have demonstrated that mastery computer generated visuals far more important for making money than the ability write and direct for actors stargate was financial success independence day was runaway hit and with godzilla already drowning hype and merchandising tie ins before even opens virtually guaranteed least 100 million nice numbers for film that could have been penned not too precocious grade school kid godzilla isn completely without merit although close there certain visceral thrill inherent watching the giant lizard rip his way through manhattan but wears off quickly frankly while the special effects are competent they not all that stunning there nothing new here jurassic park meets aliens with little independence day thrown for bad measure maybe will require george lucas and his new star wars movie take computer generated visuals the next level godzilla never really pushes the envelope preferring remain within comfort zone the imagination monster movies like king kong has been replaced crass formulaic approach which disallows creativity how disturbing know that godzilla has been chosen close the 51st cannes film festival worst all godzilla isn even exciting with the possible exception mildly enjoyable car chase near the end there isn sequence this film that raises the pulse even the scenes with dozens aircraft attacking the monster are devoid tension and suspense that they are yawn provoking independence day may have been dumb but was full adrenaline moments capable getting the audience involved the action this aspect its production many others godzilla lacking actually part the problem that never sure who supposed rooting for the green monster with attitude the paper thin humans trying stop him the plot such can summed rather simply after sinking few ships and leaving some footprints tropical islands godzilla shows the big apple does some the usual tourist things stops madison square garden visits the chrysler building goes walk through central park and takes the subway the process knocks over few buildings and steps countless cabs but never has trouble with traffic jams hand stop him elite army unit led slightly less arrogant than usual military man kevin dunn and biologist named nick tatopoulos who has theory about godzilla his opinion the big guy actually lizard grown enormous proportions result the radiation given off french atomic bomb tests the south pacific nick words godzilla mutated aberration incipient creature the first its kind luck would have nick old girlfriend audrey maria pitillo reporter based new york station along with her cameraman friend animal hank azaria she decides follow nick around trails godzilla then just when the military has rejected nick theory about why godzilla new york member the french secret service jean reno recruits him for special assignment instead stomping around tokyo this time godzilla has chosen new york city unfortunately manhattan has been destroyed many times recent disaster movies independence day deep impact armageddon that becoming boring the whole tradition monsters roaming around the city started with king kong but the big ape was only about feet tall could climb the empire state building ten times that height godzilla would more likely knock over godzilla contains few lame attempts humor there ongoing feud between animal and his wife that plays like sit com material unfunny and repetitive gag about how one can pronounce nick last name properly and rather tame attack film critics roger ebert and gene siskel both the popular personalities have alter egos the film ebert the mayor new york played michael lerner and gene lorry goldman his campaign manager ebert election slogan not surprisingly thumbs for new york the siskel ebert stuff amusing the first time used but after while grows tiresome and although the characters don serve any real purpose they keep popping godzilla saddled with unimpressive cast this largely because emmerich doesn want risk human performance upstaging his lizard that not say that matthew broderick and jean reno aren capable good performances both have done their share solid acting the past but they aren list names then again considering the quality the writing even pacino and deniro would have been hard pressed shine maria pitillo dear god plays the love interest and hank azaria great expectations hand present what supposed comic relief ultimately doesn really matter what any other critic for that matter have say about the movie tristar has assumed that godzilla like all self proclaimed summer event motion pictures pretty much critic proof may also word mouth proof those who want see the movie will see matter what write their friends say when record assert that godzilla one the most idiotic blockbuster movies all time like

1 |text there was lot riding this movie everyone even moderately interested the scream series was dying know how would end what would the final act this the end era for them movie which has kept them nights searching for clues the internet talking and tossing around rumors with their equally enthused buddies and for kids under those elaborate plots consisting buying ticket one movie and hopping into scream while narrowly escaping those menacing ushers who are only year two older than themselves need worry scream endlessly inventive and entertaining fine epilogue the series that made kevin williamson household name reinvented the horror genre and continued the self referential post modern tradition quentin and how does the story opposed what some fanatical internet sites would have you believe sidney prescott neve campbell now all grown and constantly dealing with her pass the constantly tormented sector her psyche not living hollywood fulfilling her dream become actress but rather upstate california living understandably alone the confines fences and vast security systems she works home crisis center affiliate over the phone but that not where the movie starts off instead tactic that reminded the somewhat similar and conceptually horrifying sequence eye for eye 1995 cotton weary liev schreiber now big star drives home his girlfriend traffic when the killer calls demands the location sidney home and when doesn get threatens the life cotton girlfriend christine and cotton can anything stop him the rest the sequence particularly clever setting constant throughout the picture the killer has high tech electronic voice changer that tops that the first two not only does sound unmistakably like talented voice over artist roger jackson can now easily duplicate the voices the lead characters including sidney and the returned gale weathers courtney cox arquette and dewey riley david arquette the same time stab the third film within film based around the characters and events woodsboro and windsor college has taken less authentic approach this time around return woodsboro whereas the account the first two films was true the franchise within scream has now become totally fictional nevertheless learn cotton made appearance the movie which now production himself killed off the first scene seems that the real killer offing our heroes the order which they bite the movie either the actor portraying them the real thing sometimes both clever indeed but who goes next one knows three different scripts were penned told keep the true finale off the internet nod the scream fiasco few years back and one knows for sure which one the killer read still all the while sidney stays concealed her home only visiting dad for the first half hour the film while also having horrifying visions her mother which takes back bit sidney fear becoming what her mother was least what her mother was secretly when sidney finally ventures out hollywood the murders become more prevalent she chased onto the set stab wandering through woodsboro written and directed odd surreal nightmare indeed this one scream finest moments okay over the years admit that become quite the scream fan don have the ghostface costume the director cut laserdisc but often find myself compelled pop the dvd either member the preceding duo and can get quite caught the dramatic element these films yes said dramatic element sometimes debating with family and friends the possibilities and endless theories that have become quintessentially affiliated with scream throughout the film though noticed much more subtle approach than the other two films granted that there stabbin plenty going throughout but there considerably less blood less gore honestly like this approach more classical more rebellious constantly demonstrating the capable direction wes craven knows when hold back and the same time makes the movie ooze with energy illustrating the delicate poise flowing from his years experience some critics have noted that scream seems take itself more seriously this time maybe maybe screenwriter ehren kruger arlington road who took over after williamson had scheduling conflicts saw opportunity for true irony maybe even little bit satire the film worked few more clich what puts damper this otherwise exceptional and creative film afraid the ending rather the identity the killer does the job guess accomplishes what should bringing the three films full circle but upon first viewing seemed rather dissatisfying because appears little too contrived too arbitrary after second viewing which endeavored upon due this recurring disapprobation the killer identity still seems little too random but his motivation came across more sound this time around and the eventual conclusion was ultimately more satisfying all all scream does not fall victim the most lamented principle trilogy not the worst the films trilogy scream was lot fun refreshing humorous offbeat almost sad see but then does seem best quit while you ahead and scream does fine job providing closure its characters for now scream holds the title the finest series horror films committed celluloid not too shabby
-1 |text opinion film can easily swayed the presence actors love love ralph fiennes love uma thurman love sean connery hell even big fan jim broadbent and fiona shaw saw the fantastic preview for the avengers nearly eight months ago and been eagerly awaiting the film ever since few months into the summer however noticed that its release date had been changed few times and that had ended the mid august dumping ground then this final week before its official release learned that was not screened for critics and that the actors had not been plugging the film late night programs and that was directed the same man who brought the remake diabolique expectations fell pieces when learned all these things the film saw today didn even meet those expectations this lousy incoherent mess would slam harder weren for the nifty sets and the mere presence all these fine lovable actors but sets are ultimately empty and the performances are completely uninspired that the main problem with the avengers for all hip hop flash and tidal waves none feels the least bit energetic inspired like chore bland exercise superhero film making also feels like its been cut pieces clocking minutes and forgetting close some its own subplots this just plain depressing the avengers film version the popular 60s television show frequent readers mine will not surprised learn that never watched episode wasn alive then don even watch television now very sorry that don have this perspective but judging from the reviews already read knowing the show just makes matters worse didn know and love john steed and emma peel and therefore was not upset see how these actors love have managed thrash their roles also doubt that familiarity with the series would allow understand more clearly the chain events that take place this film based what the film told gather that steed fiennes some kind british super guy somewhat like james bond and that peel thurman just really smart doctor who also happens know lot about weather and about beating people while limited tight leather suits they are work together under mother orders mother played jolly jim broadbent while his conspirator father played the equally talented fiona shaw seems that there man out there controlling the weather his name wynter connery crazy scottish guy our heroes had better stop him else the weather will keep getting colder until they have hell warm one the film few funny lines along the way there subplot after subplot hinged sloppily together scenes that nowhere feel perfunctory and ultimately make sense for example our heroes are eventually attacked swarm giant mechanical insects with machineguns attached their torsos now killer bugs don really with the weather controlling theme the film the purpose the bugs other than annihilate our heroes never established they never even directly connected wynter they controlled his crazy henchman played eddie izzard the special effects aren bad but they loud obnoxious and intrusive like many scenes the film seems present only keep your attention from waning and guarantee you will wane stopped thinking about the story when realized didn any good think the avengers has clearly been chopped and assembled many times that even the people involved couldn tell what happens there are several scenes the preview that didn make the final cut addition many the sequences have irritating grainy film quality which makes feel low budget the last scene particularly bad the scenes that don feature action should electric thanks our wonderful cast they aren the action scenes should electric because this action film they aren either and what about this wasted cast makes weep with disappointment talking ralph fiennes here one the best actors working today one the best actors ever love the guy loved all his films until this one seems like wants understand the film but lost are and thurman all her spectacular beauty and talent can manage look home here don blame her completely for there strange subplot involving her evil twin that never explained any way and can easy deal with such terrible screenwriting connery however seems the most out totally lacking any kind focus interest for that matter who blame the screenwriter don macpherson perhaps although can see shell story here that could have been good superhero movie had been handled right the actors for god sake these people clearly lost interest when they saw the inevitable path destruction which this film was travelling blame director jeremiah chechik who shouldn have been given the task begin with his best film benny joon quirky the same way that this one was supposed but here mostly seems like lot failed attempts wit and humor add that lack experience big budget action and you have the worst choice for director this side james ivory the avengers has saving grace the set design the sets stuart craig are big colorful and often pleasing look like the final set piece wynter island even none makes bit sense admired the overhead view the stairs showing peel running around circles and never getting anywhere also enjoyed michael kamen music score particularly the opening credits but this stuff routine good sets and music are nice but there lot more that needs here inspiration for instance would have been really nice maybe little bit cohesion the story sense purpose most all though would have liked see these actors relish their roles damn this movie for not giving them the chance
-1 |text weighed down tired plot lines and spielberg reliance formulas _saving private ryan_ mediocre film which nods the direction realism before descending into abyss cliches there ought law against steven spielberg making movies about truly serious topics spielberg greatest strength director the polished formulaic way which every aspect the film falls carefully into place make perfect story but for topic such weight combat the second world war the holocaust this technique backfires for creates coherent comprehensible and redemptive narratives out events whose size complexity and evil are utterly beyond the reach human ken this way spielberg trivializes the awesome evil the stories films _saving private ryan_ tells the story eight men who have been detailed mission pull young man ryan whose three other brothers were just killed fighting elsewhere out combat the normandy front just after day ryan paratrooper who dropped behind enemy lines the night before the landings and became separated from his fellow soldiers the search for him takes the eight soldiers across the hellish terrain world war combat france there denying spielberg came within shouting distance making great war movie the equipment uniforms and weapons are superbly done the opening sequence which captain miller tom hanks leads his men onto omaha beach quite possibly the closest anyone has come actually capturing the unendurably savage intensity modern infantry combat another pleasing aspect the film spielberg brave depiction scenes largely unknown american audiences such the shooting prisoners allied soldiers the banality death combat the routine foul ups the execution the war and the cynicism the troops the technical side the film peerless always the camera work magnificent the pacing perfect the sets convincing the directing without flaw hanks will doubt nominated for oscar for his performance which was utterly convincing and the supporting cast was excellent though ted danson seems mite out place paratroop colonel yet the attempt realistic depiction combat falls flat its face because realism not something which can represented single instances events has thoroughly permeate the context every level the film the story fails convince throughout the movie spielberg repeatedly showed only single examples the grotesque wounds produced modern mechanized devices exception men are shown burning death with relative frequency for example see only one man with guts spilled out the ground here and there men lose limbs one scene miller pulling man safety there explosion and miller looks back see only pulling half man but the rest the corpses are remarkably intact there are shoes with only feet them limbs scattered everywhere torsos without limbs charred corpses and most importantly all corpses have heads fairness there are smattering wicked head wounds the relentless dehumanization the war which even corpses failed retain any indentity soft pedaled the film ultimately _saving private ryan_ bows both hollywood convention and the unwritten rules wartime photography its portrayal wounds and death war rather than saying _saving private ryan_ realistic would better describe having realistic moments another aspect the hollywoodization the war the lack realistic dialogue and particular the lack swearing anyone familiar with the literature the behavior the men during the war such fussell superb _wartime understanding and behavior the second world war_ which has extensive discussion swearing knows that the troops swore fluently and without letup who this private ryan that have die for him asks one infantrymen the group eight rendered wartime demotic that should have been expressed who this little pecker that have get our dicks shot off for him some variant thereof conversations should have been literally sprinkled with the word and largely about the search for food and sex this all the more inexplicable because the movie already had rating due violence swearing could not possibly have been eliminated make family film however the most troubling aspect the film the spielbergization the topic the most intense hell humans have ever created for themselves not emotionally wrenching enough for steven spielberg cannot just cede control the material has bigger than afraid let the viewer find their own perhaps unsettled and not entirely clear emotional foothold the material spielberg has package hallmark moments give the war meaning and coherence never had the opening and closing scenes ryan and his family the war cemetary reminscent the closing scene from _schindler list the saccharine exchange between ryan and his wife the close every bit bad schindler monologue about how his car tiepin ring could have saved another jew quotes from abraham lincoln and emerson captain miller last words private ryan and unbelievable storyline which prisoner whom they free earlier the movie comes back kill the captain that particular subplot hokey predictable nigh ruins the film nowhere the film there resolute depiction the meaninglessness stupidity and waste which characterized the experience war the men who actually fought combat imagine miller had been killed friendly fire collateral damage because its failure mine deeply into the terrible realities world war _saving private ryan_ can only pan for small truths

action from the very beginning skipping the usual main title sequence and putting pitching waves small family attempts escape from sinking ship father mother and infant somehow make shore amidst rousing song phil collins and have soon built treehouse which would impress the swiss family robinson amazing the kinds things you can when you work soundtrack before you know unfortunate set circumstances put the baby the hands kala glenn close mother ape who recently lost her own baby predatory leopard against the wishes her mate and family leader kerchak lance henricksen she takes the infant boy her own tarzan not much story about human boy surviving the african jungles about one who does not really fit either humanity the wild much tarzan young life spent trying become one the apes the eyes his peers and his father which occasionally gets him into trouble matter how well meant his attempts all looking for acceptance perhaps goal easily identifiable young viewers but one which will ring true with lot adults when you really think about this story fits right into the disney formula the outcast that triumphs the end look back past disney animated features and you see the trend growing tarzan voiced alex linz child and tony goldwyn adult has couple friends one ape named terk rosie donnell and the other paranoid hypochondriac elephant named tantor wayne knight both provide the requisite comic relief timon and poombah from the lion king immediately come mind and perform the usual hijinks prescribed the disney mold beginning think anyone can write the screenplay for one these films just fill the blanks can you see now have have couple zany friends for out hero who might get him into mischief but cover for him come his rescue when needs already had fish and crab and had candle and teapot genie and dog few stone statues have had ape and elephant yet well there course there gotta romance somewhere along the line jane minnie driver gets introduced about halfway through together with her father porter nigel hawthorne and the big game hunter clayton brian blessed jane expedition find and study the wild gorillas africa she discovers the man raised apes and enchanted almost immediately and soon shares amusing version the compulsory you tarzan jane scene thankfully those aren the exact words however found distracting that tarzan going ohh ohh one second and then tells jane his name this manly voice with perfect diction how does tell his name another ape ohh ohh tarzan ohh well regardless picky nature the romance actually works only disney romance can purely contrived but for some reason rather believable but hey tarzan young adult you think dated few the female apes before meeting jane isn that illegal most countries well don think disney will using quote anymore tarzan departs from the usual disney feature that this one not musical there lots music sure but not single character song the whole hour and half running time instead get more phil collins concert less than five his original songs are used interlude material this isn really bad thing the songs are very high energy and catchy found myself singing one myself for most the following day just different yourself favor and see this film theater with good sound system because the music will come through astonishingly well and really enhance the movie with each new feature disney animation gets even better not necessarily leaps and bounds but since they put out new film each year steady rate improvement apparent and this definitely shows tarzan there are couple scenes where the animation achieves near effect and number scenes which feature tarzan moving through the trees are absolutely dizzying the way slides down tree limbs and trunks very reminiscent skateboarding and rollerblading maneuvers and had thinking this isn just tarzan extreme tarzan however tarzan does not seem have what call its chandelier scene which the one scene which the animators have chosen devote inordinate amount effort utilizing computer assisted process that makes the animation absolutely breathtaking lasting but few seconds most been the signature nearly every disney animated feature since beauty and the beast which the castle ballroom chandelier was rendered stunning detail usual the voice talent snuff convincingly make you believe the convictions animated characters the one poor choice casting however was rosie donnell going into the film didn know she was even part but when terk started talking recognized her voice immediately her performance was fine but through the rest the film kept thinking that boy ape that rosie donnell distracting say the least admit never read the edgar rice burroughs story tarzan the apes couldn tell you how true this film stays the book but unless you purist you should have few objections this film with solid performances action adventure bit romance and great music and animation tarzan should appeal the kids and the kid all note when wrote review mulan year ago went off the promotional and merchandising tie ins prevalent with the release disney animated feature this time just say that went mcdonald yesterday treat myself mcflurry and tarzan was the cup nuff said

they get they break into pairs and investigate and they find alien lifeform board that comes the form energy has taken over all the machines board have meshed the machines with parts from corpses and have deemed humankind their enemy because misquote the dictionary not that any this for second scary the least bit involving not only does this film start off with chintzy bond ian opening the destruction the cruiser via satellite transmission from mir destroying any the suspense what could happen but also fails bring any interesting chracters its motley crew only choses its potentially eccentric cast characters lead woman skipper masculine potential romantic interest drunken captain black technician tatooed aborigine manic russian survivor and couple other candidates for alien food none whom are the least bit interesting more dimensional than thin plain piece writing paper and not the traditional argument for films like these where you may fact want them all eaten even aliens played with the karma the arrogant soldiers but this was more plus side for the film whole than the opposite instead another cliche goes you just don give damn almost don even have say that the acting from everyone ranges from sub par horrific the former being jamie lee curtis the lead showing off what strong female lead she and she just not really here and the latter being and pains say this particular favorite mine donald sutherland who plays the captain poorly and without second credibility that this will down the performance which should ashamed like anthony hopkins for legends the fall the line scrooooooo has been thus embroidered upon membrance peter toole caligula great actor horrific performance happens every now and then and only helps sutherland career that one except for elite few even bothered see this film though has sat the shelves universal studios for about two years waiting until can released and make much money possibly can read early january when everyone still trying catch the potential oscar nominees does show that universal shelled out pretty penny make this film laden with complex machinery boasts respectable production design and may even feature believable special effects course anyone else could see them virus mostly takes place large abandoned cruiser and mostly night until the dawn and mostly without the use lights not much for the productivity the alien creatures their pursuit their human prey but more because the hollywood cliche seems dark enough then the special effects will more believable and you don believe back and rent godzilla and tell there even one shot where see godzilla either his entirety one wide shot the light that can least see him well you don really have sit through again just take word for but all this doesn matter since virus basically just one loud cluttered mess movie the action scenes are muddled and difficult follow any action movie ever seen favorite part was the scene where trio them end somehow the outside the ship during five minute bouillabaisse tidal waves rain and any other ocean extremeties the film can cook then end back the ship when one them revealed have apparently drowned well must say thanks for telling afterwards because sure couldn figure out when saw imagine the first attack the aliens aliens shot from the pov the soldiers and then the authorities the battle car was all hard follow and done without any dramatic intensity and that basically the whole virus one horribly directed action scene after the other capping off with proposterous gadget that saves the day and least couple the original cast members and god long damn sit with interesting characters dramatic urgency tension not one good moment action and mesmerizing visuals wonder that even got made already know that big movie studios mentality shallow best and movies like out sight and saving private ryan give you more faith them but movies like virus manage drain little more out the pool almost wish that instead making this movie john bruno had gone cinema verite and captured the meetings with universal heads when they gave this film green light they read the script they knew they were entrusting millions upon millions dollars into director who might have very well been cameron hack and and they still went ahead with the project only have bruno and company shit back their face even though hold universal contempt for making this horrible movie say even more contempt should aimed bruno for making movie that could this bad fact shouts egad man what were you doing when you worked for cameron anyway are not only justifiable but encouraged

-1 |text when respecting director you must also respect the fact that they are not perfect woody allen has made couple less than good films and favorite even martin scorsese hasn had perfect track record kevin smith after smashing debut with the classic clerks stooped low sell out and make the dreadful mallrats mean far the only director who made several films none which have been bad richard linklater slacker dazed and confused before sunrise and suburbia all which were great now adore quentin tarantino his first two films were classic films the second one being one the greatest films all time but 1995 just wasn that good year for him made way too many appearances mispronounced jackie chan name the mtv movie awards and made this film was also awarded oscar guess that would grand exception robert rodriguez also great director not brilliant one but cool one never seen alexandre rockwell allison anders film can comment them but this crap ensemble director film all four give pitiful efforts pitiful for any director too now all fairness ensemble director pieces never really work out never seen all new york stories but have heard the first two films scorsese and francis ford coppola are crap saw woody one which was hilarious but not totally par but will rate each film individually and then report back you the overal average score the film exposition simple one bellhop ted the totally overdone tim roth who god and all but not this one though has couple good moments working new year eve for his first shift old fancy hotel the only one there again and only has couple rooms yet again the old bellhop the seemingly immortal marc lawrence who hated pulp fiction actually hands over his cap ted and goes his job happily the night goes becomes increasingly annoyed and hostile yea the short films are presented order btw the missing ingredient writer director allison anders starring sammi davis amanda decadenet valeria golino madonna ione skye lili taylor alicia witt this one starts off horribly with plot intrigue and crap dialogue the situation terrible that physically painful watch the plot has something with coven witches needing sperm bring back godess who gasp stuck inside some object their hotel room the witch that was supposed bring ione skye calls ted and asks him she can perform fellatio him get yeah that what said stupid plot inane characters who aren interesting all etc etc etc the only good thing about this has good cast which turn wastes pitifully not even actually funny for second rating out stars the wrong man writer director alexandre rockwell starring david proval jennifer beals and laurence bender another bad little film with another stupid sex thing going ted stumbles into the wrong room something and gets the middle couple david proval and jennifer beals her attempt coming back who are playing sex games ted tries escape and cheer him will end soon but least this has bit comedy just not that much and david proval has never overacted much and pulp fiction producer laurence bender who gets puke from window masterpiece compared the first one but still the misbehavers writer director robert rodriguez starring antonio banderes tamlyn tomita lana mckissack danny verduzco salma hayek would robert rodriguez film the same without salma hayek navel nope luckily she the dancing get see her surprisingly enough when read the screenplay about year before actually seeing this one seemed have the most potential was fast paced funny and well funny but when watched seemed anti climactic and only seemed gain any momentum towards the end when everything happened once antonio overacts nicely and the two kids lana and danny are funny but said moves slowly and that way more painful than funny but the ending was stupid and funny the same time the plot antonio supposed gangster assumed really who leaves his two troubling kids home while and his wife tomita out get drunk new year party antonio hires ted for couple bucks watch his kids all night long but things wrong was okay the man from hollywood writer director quentin tarantino starring quentin tarantino bruce willis paul calderon and jennifer beals again ironically this one could considered the best for bad reason best represents what quentin has done with this film plays chester spoiled brat actor something who has just had huge box office hit his hands and living playing anti climactic game from hitchcock episode starring steve mcqueen and peter lorre where they gamble see one them can get light from his lighter ten times row they drunk and need sober but nervous ted hold the cleaver and bring down the lighter doesn light they also pay him lot cash this much exactly what this little film about that campy tim roth was probably payed lot money this stupid part this stupid film made bunch people who are high themselves cause they had hits major minor took quentin realize that but the thing doesn seem like realizes that did give this good stars but this sucked was anti climactic and the dialogue wasn very good starts off with very long steadicam shot then goes flashes that makes sense cool for while then makes uneven long and just not very good hopefully quentin never repeats what did with this one conclusion what the moral here you made celebrated films don ensemble piece they should have watched new york stories and then stopped their tracks none these have any point them and they embarrassing not only the writer directors but the actors cause they working with crap but will forgive everyone involved and especially look forward quentin next directing job even though and rodriguez jumped back the top immeadiately with the cool from dusk till dawn which found exhilerating love quentin and suppose good made the man from hollywood because makes him seem more realistic and not some god cinema seem respect directors they aren gods and are actually human beings who make mistakes the man from hollywood his big mistake and let hope doesn return her continuously

1 |text avid fan the alien saga this review obviously tad biased least admitted course that doesn mean that gonna giving this four star review something because alien resurrection the fourth film the cool hell series not absolutely amazing film much like the first two were however very good film which never fails entertain and consists yet another mutation the style the series short had good time alien resurrection leaves off 200 years after the last one where our heroine protagonist ellen ripley sigourney weaver the science fiction genre answer job had killed herself after discovering that alien was inside her body waiting pop out like did john hurt the first one course the last one wasn very great anything liked though not much the first two and more importantly wasn financially successful tawdry million bucks back are with ripley back clone which means get another little satirical look cloning not that that bad thing but becoming cliche she cloned aboard even more futuristic looking ship called the auriga some doctors including the necessary bad government guy wren played freeman well the little seen gediman played none other than brad douriff mainly because they have version her with the alien still inside her once you get past the fact that you can figure out where they got her blood although think might have been from the blood samples taken charles dance the third one the film okay also board are band mercenary pirates including michael wincott ron perlman kim flowers raymond cruz dominique pinon jeunet sytable and winona ryder who plays analee call who turns out have bit secret won state but unless you been shacking with salinger for the past two years you probably know all about although nicely covered there bit non sexual yet slightly homoerotic relationship between her and ripley but never really deepened enough well well you might have guessed the alien and its spawn escape and run around the ship and pretty much does away with most the people the ship including some shocks dan hedaya for instance who death comical yet sad since well dan hedaya and the remaining people about are left try and escape and stop the aliens from doing any major harm since the ship heading quickly towards earth course the plot all balderdash and just excuse for some good old alien brand fun the real focus the series seems style not really substance although there always bit most notably aliens with the relationship between ripley and the little girl what interesting about the series that each film stylistically different its approach alien claustrophobic exercise quiet frights aliens wild tense thriller alien bleak moody piece semi noir alien kind like off beat french film filled with lots humor and cool scares jean pierre jeunet without his usual directing partner marc caro creates ship filled with the kind scares films like das boot has with echoes hinting possible threat the chills the film are really cool especially with the music which sometimes turned down completely for certain scenes there the most tense surgery scene since face off towards the beginning and not every chill turns into bloody mess anything like that this all combined with some good old humor makes this interesting visually and stylistically the others there are even couple scenes which just stick out afterwards being brilliantly executed one the aforementioned surgery scene another one takes place between call and ripley which just awesome the underwater chase scene and the ladder scene afterwards one the most tense thrilling and jaw dropping scenes the entire saga with small allusion jeunet earlier film delicatessen and the way they the final alien hysterically cool with lovely allusion goldfinger but the best scene the entire film sure not the first mention takes place when ripley sees all the variations her they cloned her she has tatooed her arm might the most emotionally stimulating scene the entire saga the screenplay joss whedon not great piece work never really deapens lot the characters however does make care about most them that when there very little them and looks like one more them may become alien chow are pretty scared and yeah there are some very funny lines ripley who have fuck get off this boat johner well can get you off but not this ship the acting good all around with stand out performances from ron perlman the male chauvenist pig johner and leland orser the poor bastad se7en who performed the lust sin anxiety ridden wannabe woody allen who has alien inside him winona ryder good but not amazing like she usually although she meshes well with the film course and usual sigourney weaver steals the show playing variation the ripley character less emotional and more rude and bitter she pulls off while still being utterly lovable she not going get oscar nomination like she did for aliens but she just awesome overall thrilling entertaining film which doesn really amaze like the first two but much more amazing than the third installment the style the best part the film which isn really bad thing but being the best part takes away from lot the depth the film occasionally tries apply but entertaining hell and definitely fit for the alien series

hit didn care for any the characters being played actors didn really like when the sole reason you care about character being played sidney poitier suspense film because being played sidney poitier you know something rotten the state denmark every year couple films like this are released you know the cheap action packed international espionnage film featuring semi promising premise some big name actors usually bruce willis and the hopes that some audience members will forget the cold war ended several years ago this was the third one following the very lackluster the saint which featured amoral costume changing bond wannabe and the surprisingly fun the peacemaker featuring clooney and kidman trying stop almost untraceable villain the jackal tries mix both elements and you thought the saint was bad the jackal loosely very loosely hope based the 1973 fred zimmerman classic that yet see the day the jackal which featured apparently suave hitman called the jackal played edward fox trying assasinate charles degaule well welcome the 90s where sorta suave hitman also called the jackal bruce willis trying kill the head the fbi after being hired russian mob lord bit vengeance for the murder his brother killed the opening scenes the jackal romps all over the northen hemisphere from helsinki virginia setting elaborate scheme wherein able assasinate this person and still get away live seclusion and like the saint the jackal changes his look over and over and over again elude people the agent working the case cater preston sidney poitier yes that sidney poitier working with russian agent valentina koslova diane venora lady capulet from romeo juliet gives early and meets with ira man declan mulqueen richard gere putting some tight competition between himself and brad pitt for worst fake irish accent who massachusetts jail but who has apparently seen the jackal who has been eluding the law forever soon out working with the two untrusting agents and trying help them catch him there are numerous problems with the film and which one the biggest one pretty impossible put finger the film supposed big suspense thriller but save couple moments the film never achieves suspense even sense intrigue sure the big assasination attempt bit cool looking and even slightly tense but every other scene the film too short and too dull register the film never picks enough become thrilling experience even entertaining one doesn help that the plot designed complex but falls into many problems like plot holes and unbelievable circumstances the script the jackal complete mess mostly because can decide what wants focus this film about man trying find redemption catching nasty killer film about nasty amoral hitman who everything for the money combination both the jackal aims for the latter but never focuses either character the connection between the two feels completely edited much that scene when the jackal turns around and notices declan you wonder how recognized him fast the worst part the little past they try give declan most notably his relationship with old girlfriend isabella mathilda may given little screen time that you almost forget her character exists until she pops every now and then the supporting characters are worse sidney poitier given completely unplayable role that man who just stern sometimes and other times more giving and likable what poitier doing here one the best living actors does really need waste his time doing drivel like this diane venora russian character almost bad with cigarette perpetually her mouth and plastered expressionless facade not that anyone bad here that they have nothing the plot joke feeling like was pasted together someone post production who dropped each scene the floor and pasted them together quickly could released time the jackal himself not even much international villain there are several times where tight situation and makes things worse for himself the only explanation being that the filmmakers wanted toss cheap thrill take scene where being followed some agents into parking garage quickly sprays his car another color and adds solvent that touched kills the person who touched doesn killing someone attract more attention than does distract and does think dying his hair bottle blond makes him fit public place geez there anything good here well couple things did like willis icy expressions may not have been real suave anything but some his looks are worth chuckle richard gere has couple good moments making his character likable possibly could have and couple sequences are kicky that kind proposterous completely inane but fun kinda way most notably sequence where tests out new gun annoying gun builder jack black and bit where seduces gay washington man which has its share couple good jokes most particular kiss willis but none these elevate the film any higher than could they just little distractions along the way amuse mildly then toss back into the world dullness and stupidity that the jackal director michael caton jones who directed the far superior rob roy has made film that made very couple months one that unentertaining unintriguing and pretty much cold but will nevertheless make money because hey the trailers make look like may fun that kind retro clancy kinda way every now and then the filmmakers get right clear and present danger which was enormous fun that smart kinda way but the jackal example when they completely wrong

-1 |text snake eyes the most aggravating kind movie the kind that shows much potential then becomes unbelievably disappointing not just because this brian depalma film and since great director and one who films are always greeted with least some fanfare and not even because this was film starring nicolas cage and since gives brauvara performance this film hardly worth his talents worse than that aggravating for the sole reason that its story could much more could totally intelligent and opens with absolutely subtlety that will handled complexly and intensely then one point the movie makes wrong turn that leads the hall fame half assedness more deservedly the hall fame the eighth assedness certain circles snake eyes was being advertised kind modern day version kurosawa classic rashomon where crime told from the four different and mean different perspectives and looks though may actually just like this with the opening which might add superb one very very very long steadicam shot meet the protagonist crooked atlantic city detective rick santoro cage and follow him before boxing match talks his cell phone with his wife interupts pay per view event chases down gambler enters the arena all pumped for the fight sits down and talks with his bud kevin dunne gary sinise who character should not confused with that actor kevin dunn who also this and watches happens there big name the crowd and that the secretary defense charles kirkland joel fabiani who sitting behind rick and who gets shot second after the heavyweight champion lincoln tyler stan shaw knocked out this all happens the opening shot and creates many red herrings and possibilities what happened that opens this scene for close examination and total deconstruction what really happened this film asks and sets this film extremely well for when rick begins question people and get different perspectives the scene and discovers there very good possibility was conspiracy follow rick trying learn more information also meet woman who was talking kirkland before was shot carla gugino and who flees the scene panic and tries hide from the cops the arena and the adjacent casino hotel since the cops have blocked off the doors they can get witness takes what happened this all going pretty fine and dandy and extremely interesting watch then takes one wrong step follow the wrong character and learn the answer the mystery too early and way before rick can find out but that not the worst part that the one person you didn think would because was too obviously supposed the red herring the one you didn think did because would stupid and cliched that person behind only gets worse the film turns into chase film about half way through the film and since already know what happened can rely rick investigation all that interesting the film ran out the guts really complex and original about third the way and decided just fall back easy way out and that just happens mean that has become less and less credible events become more and more proposterous and the end the film has decided rely the worst offender mysteries like this the deux machina that where some outside intereference brings the film sudden conclusion and makes everything okay this time hurricane out control police car and big round ball that adorned the arena what went wrong depalma and the screenwriter david koepp are extremely credible people their respective fields and have been known for bringing life and complexity mysteries such this depalma who idolizes hitchcock death has done many film like this such his masterpiece blow out where movie soundman uses movie elements uncover conspiracy piece piece but granted depalma least makes intriguing watch what with his over the top shot set ups notably the beginning and sequence where the camera pans over top bunch rooms the hotel forgetting anything about boundaries least his direction makes partly for then there koepp who showed such great ability making character flaws come life like did depalma earlier carlito way film that dove right into the life and past its character and examined him extremely well can write flawed character but his rick santoro seems just half assed effort flawed and can see redemption the story wasn formulaic scene towards the end where has make fatal decision cheapened the fact that his answer has emotional buildup may well have said the opposite what says would have least gone with what the character was like this the most disappointing kind film because promises intelligence and complexity because promises disection flawed character and perhaps even redemption then pulls the rug from under just were about convinced would able all the way was watching the first half hour couldn wait see how the mystery would unearthed how many different perspectives given and perhaps have make choice between who has believe now there film unfortunately the film has two major deux machinas one the disasterous ending the other about half hour when the film goes into autopilot and becomes stale and recycled piece crap seen all too much before but never from someone like depalma

made throughout the years almost every part the world including the most controversial version them all directed james whale the dark and stormy nights the lightning bolts the charnel houses spare body parts the laboratory where victor frankenstein stirs his steaming cauldron life are effectful but the center the film quieter and more thoughtful contains the real story horror fans will probably disappointed the total lack horror branagh has instead concentrated serious issues morality philosophy and human elements the story and not old fashioned horror cliches his version much closer the

harmony this idyllic lifestyle suddenly changed like thunder from quite sky his mother dies giving birth his youngest brother shocked baffled and then gradually changed grief and despair victor already interested science becomes obsessed with death standing his mother grave says mother you did not have die one should ever die will stop this promiss after proposing marridge his surrogate

death composing dead bodies frankenstein wanted create the perfect man both physically and mentally with strong electrical impulses managed breeth life into his creation the result was ugliness realizing what has done frankenstein tried undo his work but was late the creature has escaped because the epidemic frankenstein hoped that his creation has died and returned his home making plans for the wedding for while everything was before his mother death but then one one his loved once are dying mysteriously whale picture although powerful never managed capture the total depth the novel brannagh has more less done that another thing characters and actors branagh has developed every character and assembled magnificent cast the greatest performances comes from niro the monster that has been played among others charles ogle karloff lon chaney bela lugosi glenn strange christopher lee fred gwynne herman munster and now robert niro alone hated and feared completely aware his ugliness first like helpless abandoned child desperately reaching out for love later when reads frankenstein journal and learns that composed dead bodies his love turns into rage seeking revenge capable killing without regret took him the throughout and lifted him off the ground and then slowly crushed his neck and killed him saw your face that how reveals his savage nature his creator and yet never quite evil our eyes and his vaulerbility and his loneliness are palpable for the sympathy one living being would make peace with all rarely has cinematic interpretation the daemon approached the level three dimensionality and humanity with which portrayed the novel another vital thing the character victor frankenstein most the previous adaptions was simply mad scientist that trolls the graveyards for corpses and then creates monster god knows why with the power electrical storm almost time was granted his charecter who the most important and vital charecter the novel here branagh introduces the character victor frankenstein establishes his obsession with the very nature life and death sets the intellectual and ideological conflict between victor and the academic establishment and somehow manages build rousing and horrifying creation scene branagh plays frankenstein with remarkable understanding his character the outside strong ambitious and talented scientist but deep down unsecure fragile and vaulerble constantly haunted the ghosts from his past helen boham carter equally wonderful frankenstein surrogate sister who the end becomes his wife for little while before death drives them apart the rest the cast playing secondary characters solid and nothing less than convincing visually the film stunning especially the makeup the spinning camera the constantly building musical acore the art direction the production design the costumes are all magnificent from the arctic ocean the swiss alps and dark forests the plague riddled streets ingolstadt mary shelley frankenstein wonder behold kenneth branagh directs his film the script was written shakespeare all once loved lies shallow grave hand and the film ends exacly hamlet when the creature sets both his and his creator body fire the film ends with frankenstein and his creation burning the almost hellish fire the darkness and terrifying last close the creature smiling face can man create life then abandon his creation because its appearance horrifies him whom are its actions then attributable the creature the being who brought about its existence shelley did not answer these questions but she certainly posed them following her example branagh does the same his film tragic saga about playing god victor frankenstein not evil man wanted change the world the better this represents everything science stands for acting without doubts never considering the consequences his actions produced francis ford coppola frankenstein resembles some respects coppolas previous film dracula comparison can say that dracula has visuals that even frankenstein can not live but when comes story characters and casting frankenstein stronger but stronger than both them every aspect neil jordan interview with the vampire although the film not perfect the camera that simply refuses stay still and the occasionally pushy score are times more tiering than effective these minor faults are easily forgivable the picture otherwise captivating and stimulating branagh has probably created one the best not the best adaptions shelly classic novel

with the loss and grief that brings cold winter day small isolated town british columbia school bus full children slides off the highway and onto frozen lake where cracks through the ice and sinks fourteen children die and numerous others are hurt for the residents this small town all whose children were that bus earth shattering event that resolutely alters their lives they have always relied each other the past deal with heartache and pain but seems that this tragedy more than they can handle alberta and risa walker who own local motel and lost their child the accident hire attorney named mitchell stephens ian holm bring lawsuit against someone anyone for responsibility the bus driver dolores driscoll gabrielle rose kindly woman who loved the children and although she lives with burden guilt not held responsible for the accident the bus seems have simply slipped some ice and there was nothing should could prevent however according stephens there are accidents life and someone will pay for this tragedy whether that the manufacturer the bus the guardrail the bus broke through goes through the town approaching the parents who have lost children asking them join the class action suit and find vent for their anger and for his work stephens will receive one third the settlement money however immediately apparent that stephens has little interest the money driven something else something deeper that shares common with the grieving parents has lost child too but not the same manner his daughter zoe caerthan banks who once almost died his arms young child after spider bite has been and out drug hab clinics and detox stations for ten years she calls him irregular basis begging him for money but refusing tell him what she needs for don know who taking tells her his mind his daughter dead the lawsuit stephens not only way mend the town pain but also his own however not everyone town wants happen billy ansell bruce greenwood who was driving behind the bus when the accident happened and lost two children wants nothing with has already lost his wife and buries his grief affair with married woman doesn want talk about the accident and sees the lawsuit nothing more than the unnecessary opening old wounds him the town should able take care its own pain and doesn need outsiders like stephens getting the way central the sweet hereafter the tale nicole burnell sarah polley teenage girl who dreams being singer before the accident turned her into wheelchair girl she puts aside from stephens nicole the most complex character the film and she who ultimately decides the fate the town and how the lawsuit will turn out also her sad haunted voice that often hear the soundtrack reading robert browning poem about the pied piper and how when led all the town children away one was left behind because was crippled obviously nicole that child and she feels somehow betrayed that the rest the town children left her alone dying the wreck her situation further complicated because she involved loving but incestuous relationship with her father tom mccamus there only one fleeting scene that suggests this relationship but somehow tied into the final act the film all the storylines the sweet hereafter this the most complicated and unresolved although its implications stretch throughout the entirety the film egoyan knows that the kinds questions brings have simple answers any all and doesn condescend the audience trying neatly wrap what egoyan has done the sweet hereafter really nothing short miraculous his adaptation the novel russell banks has made deeply moving film about lawyer transcending the pettiness law and driving headlong into the deeper meaning what loss and how pitiful monetary and material possessions are when compared human life egoyan has always been talented but distant and cerebral filmmaker whose work suffered only that felt cold the sweet hereafter quite the opposite egoyan stylistic and narrative structures work brilliantly heighten the impact the natural emotion and draw the audience into the tragedy the sweet hereafter seems contain the combined emotional impact that all his other films lacked the film filled with beautiful subtle performances from all the actors especially ian holm the lawyer and sarah polley the sad child who was left behind the beautiful roving camerawork paul sarossy and the haunting melodic musical score mychael danna both previous egoyan collaborators give the film visual and aural cohesiveness with the thematic elements like his earlier films egoyan weaves together multiple storylines that form blanketing whole works with time fluid substance shifting back and forth between the past the distant past and the present with effortless ease the actual bus wreck itself doesn happen until midway through the film but that time the event has built much emotion that egoyan can film from distance with graphic detail and still have carry great devastating weight because human

all haunted hallucinations and horrible nightmares and soon they can not see the difference between dreams and reality the only thing that they are sure that they have brought something someone with them from the woods documentary director joe berlinger paradice lost helms blair witch leaving the creators the first film dan myrick and sanches the background the opening scenes the documentary showing the townspeople affected the first film more promising approach because instead trying cover similar ground goes outside the first film and makes its own stand but soon the movie gets confused and sidetracked its own story that never resolved and ends with very anticlimaxic epilogue way this typical hollywood sequel more money has been spent and more people have worked project that was doomed fail the horror and suspense the original simply could not repeated course these situations quantity more important than quality and profit more important than the artistical values from its opening scenes when the camera gracefully panes over the bloody red forest with carter burwell being john malkovich and fargo musical score the background you realize that with the exception its title this film has absolutely nothing with the blair witch project blair witch was filmed handheld videocameras and nfeatured acting that was mostly based improvisation the sequel the technical aspect the film close perfection creating completely different atmosphere with its graceful cinematography production design and flashy editing the film has very polished look which impossible associate with the first installment and though berlinger directs his film with energy and pace that makes the adrenaline rush through the body couple times has obviously misunderstood the nature his predecessor the key simplicity blair witch project had story which was incredibly simple that allowed the audience fill the gaps with our own imagination the film was practically empty screen which projected our most frightening nightmares the effect was incredibly powerful lasting and entir everyone but different way book shadows feels incredibly controlled and restrict here very little left our imagination and the story complex and clever that the screenwriters are the first get lost there book shadows and conclusion that can satisfied with this simply less artistic film that doesn have the talent and originality its predecessor resorts fancy cinematography and special effects create the right effect and doesn always succeed but most importantly stands its own ground and has almost connection with the first movie which doesn allow destroy the original the end can call bad effort less artistic not scary and less original but certainly not bad simply different fact you haven seen the blair witch project you might like this film for what cross between the blair witch project and the scream films the only element that remains constant and similar between the two films the solid acting jeffrey

1 |text swear have seen the edge before fact reminded the bear the river wild and other various films mixed into entirely different film however the edge has done something that most action films should and that add heart and characters like the plot doing the edge draws many more suspenseful moments out cliched scenes than say the peacemaker unfortunately because those overused moments can pretty much guess the outcome the film but leave screenwriter david mamet add humor and few surprises mess with your head one surprise particular left smiling just because mamet actually had the guts add his script action films are dime dozen hollywood and while they are somewhat successful entertaining they lack the one thing which would make them more respected genre intelligence even horror films have learned this genre which probably the least respected them all the river wild was one the best action suspense films have seen from the 90s the intelligence the screenplay and the suspense drawn from the realistic characters nearly unmatched this day the edge has the intelligence and smart characters but this time the lack originality the downfall must admit that was very suspenseful and had original third half but the first hour and half riddled with cliches and plot holes this example the final act saving the film instead the other way around the lost world only the screenplay had maintained the final thirty minutes intensity could have become great action film and use the term loosely the edge pretty much survival the fittest film but taking scream lead the edge makes fun the genre cliches and then uses them though not quite effectively charles morse anthony hopkins the main character rich and very intelligent man who wonders what the accumulation all this knowledge has brought him for once don immediately care for the main character instead like bob alec baldwin photographer who going take pictures charles wife mickey elle macpherson out the wilderness they board plane and head cabin somewhere the arctic charles birthday the same day and receives gold watch from his wife and pocket knife from bob action films these items have importance the rest the story but quite bit more than first expect soon however bob wants find native shoot pictures because his personality charles bob bob assistant steve harold perrineau and the pilot head off find him and shown the previews hit flock birds flying south for the winter down the plane goes the pilot killed and the three are left survive the wilderness director lee tamahori aware the silly plot which about follow and therefore has create original ways approach the situations succeeds often enough for enjoy the film take for instance the entire man hunting bear plot this has been done many times films with different animals and even bears but given the charles intelligence and bob uncertainty many the cliches are given fresh twists even charles himself seems have seen these action films before favorite line the film comes from charles most people die the wilderness because they didn the one thing that could save their life thinking despite the predictability the main plot subplot develops late the film which took surprise and made smile when realized that everything isn seems anymore have write cautiously not reveal this surprise instead will avoid entirely the first two thirds the edge have many humorous moments push along and some charles survival techniques seem possible even making fire from ice tamahori able create lot suspense from the stalking bear but whenever the bear present the characters lose all sensibility have always wondered why characters films walk over log get across water why not what intelligent person would and crawl across guess getting chased bear makes your thought process turn off for while thankfully already have begun care for the characters and let this small detail slide but some the technical details are awkward such the nice stitching done the fur coat that charles and bob make where did they get thread and needles the acting the film highly above average for film this nature and borders phenomenal anthony hopkins gives terrific performance creating his most likeable and layered character since remains the day hopkins usually brings greatness his roles but here exceeds gaining the audiences sympathy something definitely did not silence the lambs alec baldwin gives one his best performances have ever seen sure better from his fair game baldwin can good bad character and here succeeds both way you can never quite guess nice vllainous character until the end and baldwin able handle the double natured photographer elle macpherson gives good performance albeit slight she isn the film all that much but for the scenes she does have she handles actress not model harold perrineau good actor and his scenes are nice and underplayed eliminated early and reveal nothing saying this because inevitable and predictable the edge rated for graphic violence some gore and language some the violence little too disturbing even for this film nice change from the mindless action most are used but too many cliches bog down director tamahori has created very smooth and suspenseful action film out recycled parts david mamet script though has lot humor keep the first hour afloat and the acting solid the best thing about the script the ending which doesn end with the normal high strung action sequence but with small detail involving certain gift nice touch considering what have had through with the bear and the way most people laughed when the film faded black due large credit bart the bear way bart

commercial hit jaws together with other young directors his new hollywood generation like kauffman carpenter hill and millius exploited the great creative freedom 1970s when even the mainstream producers dared experiment ironically was spielberg himself whose later commercial success would established new unwritten rules blockubuster philosophy but the mid 1970s many things were different spielberg was young and eager use hollywood resources for his very personal and artistic movie although very personal spielberg screenplay was partly based the book ufo experience allen hynek and many ways inspired the popular urban mythology extraterrestrial visitors earth that began grow the world after ww2 spielberg was not only inspired the mythology but his movie also gave the mythology itself huge boost unmatched until the contemporary era files and the roswell anniversary that was partly because made the movie very realistic using the authentic ufo related incidents the element the plot the story begins with one such incidents team international scientists come the sonorra desert mexico find the navy planes who went missing decades ago during the famous flight such events coincide with the ufo incident witnessed roy neary richard dreyfuss power company worker from muncie indiana who later becomes obsessed with his experience because his obsession loses his job family and sanity but his loss nothing compared the experience jillian guiler melinda dillon single mother whose son becomes the victim alien abduction the meantime the scientists decipher the strange signals from outer space and government operation with the french led lacombe francois truffaut begin with the preparation for ultra secret project when the news the poison gas leak the middle wyoming reach neary finally sees some sense all his visions and begins the perilous journey toward the centre endangered area there joined jillian who shared the similar visions two them must break through military pickets and reach their destination find whatever there spielberg here shows great mastery using the very same techniques jaws make completely different effects the slow gradual yet very disciplined series dramatic incidents close encounters set order bring the viewer the great revelation the finale but instead the fear and horror had endure during the jaws are now overwhelmed the sense boyish wonder throughout the movie the viewer knows that something big magnificent and wonderful about happen and great magician spielberg delivers his promise the end the last sequence with its even this age impressive special effects the great virtuoso douglas trumbull would leave many mouths open one the great virtues this film its optimism aliens who almost always get portrayed the monsters science fiction cinema are here benevolent and harmless creatures and the first contact between them and humanity beginning something wonderful very ironic when consider that the two classic movies that visually inspired spielberg actually told quite different story howard hawks thing and byron haskin war the worlds presented extraterrestrials the threat the mankind spielberg humane approach and faith the future also lies great contrast the pessimistic mood its era the only hint the contemporary gloom post watergate portrayal government conspiratorial towards the public but even such government much more harmless compared the murderous and chain smoking men black that became the stereotype thanks files and its more cynical and disturbing visions there lies the main and probably the only flaw this great picture lack conflict and consequently lack drama the movie has few excitements even action scenes especially the last that may interesting homage hitchcock north northwest but generally almost everyone neary jillian government aliens are the good guys despite such shortcomings the actors were good and manage bring multidimensionality their simple roles richard dreyfuss very convincing ordinary yet nice guy who sinks into insanity only rediscover himself grand finale melinda dillon was the other hand nominated for oscar struggling mother yet she was overshadowed teri garr neary long suffering wife ronnie apart from visual wonders this film spielberg semi official composer john williams again excels his beautiful music this time using the simple melody both the element plot and the basis for his score the aliens who are the main subject this film were visually very convincing too convincing one acquaintances the ufo researching circles said according him the depiction extraterrestrials grey skinned little people with big eyes was accurate that managed freak out powerful government figures interested suppressing the truth about ufos they later approached spielberg and ordered him make another movie with alien this time designed anything but the real life the result was for many years the biggest commercial hit all times yet less inspirational for ufo enthusiasts anyway whether the viewer believes existence extraterrestrials ufos close encounters the third kind remains the great movie and one the rare uplifting experiences modern cinema

1 |text when saw the trailer for this film laughed harder than had quite some time while was therefore pretty well psyched see was ever mindful that trailer can make even the most mediocre film look good happy say that there something about mary not one those trailer let downs fact watching this film was quite fine way spend two hours the film opens flashback 1985 high school cumberland rhode island ted stroehmann ben stiller social reject who can seem get date the upcoming prom until comes the defense the mentally retarded warren earl brown who being harassed one the school jocks seems warren sister the campus queen mary jensen cameron diaz who impressed with ted willingness stand for her defenseless brother despite very real chance getting beaten mary takes immediate liking ted and asks him the prom ted was just flattered that she even knew his name unfortunately prom night ruined when ted has accident with his zipper which every man the theater will wince and sent the hospital fast forward the present where ted has cleaned himself now writes for magazine but has weekly therapy sessions order deal with his obsession the past years mary whom hasn seen since that fateful day with the help his friend dom chris elliott ted hires slimy private investigator pat healy matt dillon track down his only love however when pat finds mary falls for her too and soon the both them are competing for her affections there something about mary directed bobby and peter farrelly who brought dumb and dumber and kingpin not exactly intelligent comedies they are the guilty pleasure variety where you might not want your friends workers think you had such great time watching them with their current film the farrelly brothers have come with something you not only enjoy but also won mind talking about the next day the water cooler the film succeeds employing pretty wide range comedic styles from the subtle the ridiculous and while few the gags might offensive some seeming like residuals from the farrelly brothers last two films they almost all work have not seen many movies the recent past that shoot for the mark and often hit dead one minute you laughing something ted says and the next you howling the sight dog dragging him across the floor mary apartment one the great things this film has going for ben stiller perfectly cast the role ted because guy who just looks awkward almost every situation ted nice fellow and tries his best but for some reason another things just don always work out comical but also has that kind appeal where you really feel for the him and want him come out top actually liked stiller since did short which aired saturday night live back the mid eighties the film was like theatrical trailer for spoof the tom cruise paul newman film the color money entitled the hustler money stiller played wince not vince who taken under the wing older man played john mahoney become big time bowling hustler was parody its finest more which showed the short lived the ben stiller show the fox network late early like the critic which aired abc then fox still mourn that show cancellation cameron diaz absolutely enchanting for most the film although her character seems obsessed with perfection the men she dates and some the qualities she looks for make mary look paper thin times however diaz pulls the role off with such panache and charm that you can still see why she got guys just falling over each other with her heck even found her laugh cute even though thought was annoying during appearance she made the tonight show last week girlfriend remarked that matt dillon doesn change and you know really true and ralph macchio must hang out something maybe they live dick clark pool house anyway here another good piece casting dillon slips beautifully into the role the guy who tries worm his way into mary heart the supporting performances are also good chris elliott has bigger part than the abyss yes check out next time and less annoying than cabin boy lin shae who plays mary neighbor magda and also appeared the landlady kingpin provides some good laughs especially scenes with her benji like dog which acts the focal point for few the funniest moments the film lee evans mary friend tucker displays flexibility acting and accents which surprises and contributes interesting plot twist the farrelly brothers and scriptwriters decter and john strauss keep the comedic pacing going that there aren any noticeable times where the film drags the only problem saw was their use couple musicians who provide segues between several key scenes they appear out nowhere and actually sing plot relevant information right toward the camera device which was amusing for about three seconds when they opened the film after that got little annoying and unfortunate that those spots interrupt what would otherwise smooth flow fortunately filled with sight gags humorous lines and solid comedic acting there something about mary will still have you laughing after you leave the theater

-1 |text first rule fight club don talk about fight club this quote deals directly with opinion this film because quite frankly not even worth mentioning director david fincher seven has completely gone over the edge with crude humor intolerable script and hours and minutes pure torture surprised didn walk out this just goes show that hype kills very rare that film hyped fight club turns out noteworthy and this exception the story goes like this edward norton insomniac trying enlighten his dull life going variety disease therapy sessions until meets marla helena bonham carter norton claims that she wrecking his pleasurable lifestyle when spots her session that also attended apparently the disease sessions help them see what life like literally living pain why any person would think such thing beyond but things get worse norton soon assigned job that calls for traveling and plane that meets tyler durden brad pitt the two men develop bond and out bar and golly after they get drunk the two pitiful characters fight how they come with this stuff anyway their fighting catches other pathetic loser attention and club formed out all this mess there manages lie message fincher shows that society like robots work our jobs doing things step step and want out our insanity gets our brain and makes things worse than they really are and blame others call crazy but this common knowledge think fincher was acting the film moodier and more poignant than really which probably one the reasons fails miserably even with two good actors and solid actress they only manage weaken the story couldn help but hide face shame when norton beats himself into bloody pulp just shows how desperate the script for attention guess brad pitt was right for this role because felt like beating him myself his bothersome and depressing character made disgusted his million fee only showed that was for the money and nothing more helena bonham carter however really had purpose she just popped screen mumbled some lines smoked and left this continues for what seems like hours the film drags and headache gets bigger while fight club nears what think might the end unfortunately then the film hits rock bottom though the conclusion kept interest for mere minutes backs down again and continues move snails pace side note the trailer shows the only redeeming elements the film that coincidentally lasts the same amount time that they did the trailer fincher will hopefully regret making this film least learn lesson concentrating the atmosphere particular key moment won any good everything else need support also afraid that immature men might respond the film violence the last thing the world needs people praising leader pointless cult when the film ends just glad get home and take some advil you either enjoy what the film has offer agree with norton when says this ing stupid

-1 |text meg ryan irresistible the comedy that celebrates sisterhood screams the television ads for hanging disastrously written real life sisters delia and nora ephron and sloppily directed diane keaton make laugh again not only hanging misadvertised since the film wholeheartedly focuses middle sister meg ryan and gives her two stars lisa kudrow and diane keaton little more than extended cameos but they don actually come together until the final ten fifteen minutes and are supposed believe their strong bond and smile the last scene when they rekindle their rocky relationship despite them being apart for the majority the running time excuse again while almost bust gut that truly delusional notion eve marks meg ryan the middle mozzell sister still living the california town where she grew and with husband adam arkin and pre teen son jesse james her elderly wisecracking father lou walter matthau his brightest performance years has just recently been put into the hospital the final stages what assume alzheimer even though the film never enlightens exactly what wrong with him while eve relationship with her mother cloris leachman nearly nonexistent since she ran out lou and her children years ago she has had her fair share and down with lou who used alcoholic her older sister georgia diane keaton editor for the self titled magazine georgia while maddy lisa kudrow the youngest soap opera actress interestingly their professions are given but not once ever see them working their jobs for that matter learn much anything about them maddy georgia and eve not see each other much anymore their adult lives gradually causing them drift apart but they manage consistently talk the phone one another and they talk and talk and talk fact the telephone the major star the film even more than ryan appears virtually every scene this interminable minute catastrophe that feels like its three hours long you are able get through the opening half hour which phones ring much you feel like jumping through the screen and taking sledgehammer them you will surely survive the rest the question who would want subject themselves this resolutely irritating self involved pat the back how could comedy drama that has the star power meg ryan lisa kudrow and diane keaton very bad many different ways issues from the past involving the possible jealousy each has had for one the others fleetingly brought but the film isn mature enough deal with such thing thoughtful manner and since learn next nothing about their childhood lost cause that comes off nothing more than afterthought also expected that the viewer quickly catch the tricky dynamic that the three sisters have with one another but dynamic metamorphosizes and when they reunite the finale their whole consanguinity reduced repulsively annoying three minute scene which they argue like little children you can see the impending death coming mile away and conveniently occurs the next scene that the three can quickly come terms with themselves and with each other you think yourself the only thing left for them have playful food fight and like clockwork also occurs the end credits meg ryan versatile actress look further than 1998 hurlyburly 1994 when man loves woman despite her various detractors who stubbornly believe all she can romantic comedies with hanging the only thing she needs completely sever her filmmaking ties with nora ephron writer director hack who shouldn allowed work hollywood again after this big budget high profile debacle even she knew what she was making was not exactly par the quality department she nonetheless very good and the two scenes that work flashbacks christmas 1988 when she had heartbreaking run with her mother and halloween 1993 when lou crashed her son birthday party drunken stupor are effective because the realism ryan brings the situations diane keaton georgia better actress than director here but that wildly feeble compliment what more than little far fetched that keaton distinctly older than ryan and kudrow although the very brief glimpses get them children she more than five years ryan senior yeah right lastly poor lisa kudrow has been wasted once again big screen venture after her even more thin role 1999 analyze this kudrow isn given enough time create full personality with maddy isn her fault she doesn register until few quiet moments sprinkled throughout where she actually blessed with being given dialogue anything though kudrow real talent and anxiously await the next time she given role more deserving her time her brilliantly nuanced oscar caliber work 1998 the opposite sex you are fan kudrow and who isn yourself favor and rent this gem that puts more good use kudrow sixty seconds than hanging does its entirety eve hardworking husband adam arkin predictably squandered with role that gives him next nothing until subplot reveals itself midway through only never mentioned again cloris leachman with ryan and matthau makes small but noticeable impression with her albeit very brief appearance while edie mcclurg rosy cheeked woman lou had affair with the christmas 1988 flashback manages one the few laughs this otherwise joyless production nearly all the emotions displayed within hanging are patently manufactured and despite the movie wanting the viewer care about the characters aside from eve why would you want when they are all spoiled brats for some bizarre twilight zone type reason you find yourself movie theater showing this film suggestion would hang before the opening credits are over saying waste time understatement epic proportions

-1 |text and thought stigmata would the worst religiously oriented thriller released this year turns out was wrong because while stigmata was merely boring and self important end days completely inept all fronts silly incomprehensible endlessly stupid mess for guy like who grew watching arnold schwarzenegger his best extremely disconcerting see where the big man has ended for the first time recent memory arnold action movie and batman robin doesn count fun all end days major stinker the movie opens vatican city 1979 some catholic priests have observed ancient prophecy which says that girl will born that night that satan will have targeted for impregnation impregnates her between and midnight december 1999 the world will destroyed the pope orders protection this girl though some priests believe she ought killed new york that very night girl born fulfill the prophecy twenty years later meet jericho cane schwarzenegger suicidal cop with drinking problem now working security guard for hire protecting local businessman gabriel byrne who actually possessed the devil assassination attempt the businessman crazed former priest leads him the girl satan after christine york robin tunney recognizing elements his own murdered daughter christine including ownership the same music box apparently jericho swears protect her against the devil and the faction priests looking kill her there are many problems with this film hard know where begin but how about starting with the concept casting arnold role like this was mistake begin with schwarzenegger persona not actor putting him role that contradicts his usual strong personality bad idea arnold has neither the dramatic range nor the speaking ability pull off character tormented conflicting emotions other words trying give him dimension was mistake harrison ford mel gibson even bruce willis could have played this role they all played noble and flawed heroes but not schwarzenegger there are several scenes that attempt establish jericho character one has him contemplating suicide another crying over the loss his wife and daughter and even one which the devil tries tempt him into revealing christine location offering him his old life back none these scenes really work because arnie isn the task the filmmakers would have been better off making jericho strong confident character like the terminator for example the likes which schwarzenegger has excelled before this one isn all believable the way arnold plays him the supporting cast tries their hardest and only gabriel byrne makes any impact all the prince darkness suave and confident acts like one would expect the devil act the problem that the script has him doing things that make sense more that later and that undermines him powerful villain byrne out performs arnold every scene they have together including the aforementioned temptation bit but this problematic when causes the audience start doing the unthinkable root for the devil byrne speech about the bible being overrated actually starts make sense mainly because arnold attempts refuting mostly the tis not variety are feeble best the only problem arnold has win the end nobody really cares kevin pollack plays jericho security guard sidekick and tries liven things with some comic asides but like most bad action movie sidekicks disappears after about hour robin tunney isn given much except look scared fact all the supporting players are good actors but none save for byrne given anything interesting performances aside would really hard enjoy this film matter who starred this being action blockbuster surprise that the worst thing about the script which starts off totally confusing and when some explained and not much utterly ridiculous why the devil coming new year eve 1999 because exactly 1000 years after the year the devil which isn 666 turns out some nutty priest accidentally read upside down the real year 999 just add the beginning and you got 1999 you don buy this explanation you not alone convoluted and silly the same time the method which jericho locates christine york equally ludicrous she christine see and she lives new york see and that weren bad enough there plenty bothersome stuff this film that isn explained all why can satan kill everyone passes the street but when comes snuffing out one drunk cop powerless impervious only one kind bullet how come can control jericho christine and how did those gregorian monks deal with time zones their prophecies clumsy attempt joke made about this but never actually explained usually this sort thing wouldn matter schwarzenegger flick mean don get started the time paradoxes offered the terminator movies but this time the plot inconsistencies stand out even more than usual because the action rarely exciting there are several predictable horror film clich present end days complete with the old black cat hiding cabinet bit not that ever find out what the cat was doing there gets formulaic that possible for those uninterested being scared close their eyes the precise moment boo will come their predictions will rarely wrong the more grandiose action sequences are utterly charmless partially because don care about these characters due the script pathetic attempts characterization and setup and also because they too don make any sense there scene where schwarzenegger gets thrown around room little old lady good for few chuckles but not much else supposedly believe she now has super strength virtue being controlled satan but the script never sets that the scene merely silly none this terribly exciting because all the action sequences are badly framed that often hard tell why happening the first place not mention that they edited full incomprehensible mtv quick cut style most them had scratching head rather than saying wow cool end days not only silly and confusing but also distinctly unpleasant watch the devil apparently doesn operate the more subtle convince people kill each other fashion outlined the bible but instead enjoys killing people gruesomely broad daylight this doesn only make him awfully predictable sort but also means that not single scene end days goes without unnecessarily graphic violence the odd kinky sexual encounter yet another bit that had scratching head violence supposed shocking not good idea throw much into movie that the audience goes numb scenes aren connected through any reasonable means lot the time stuff gets blown people get killed and had idea why reasons hell with reasons let just blow stuff isn cool nope not long shot this film thoroughly unwatchable dull interminable and unrelenting its stupidity perhaps arnold needs make some movies with james cameron revive his career because not happening with hack peter hyams here end days might have had camp value only didn top itself off with overly pious ending that nobody going buy the movie going serious the filmmakers should have come with decent script going campy arnold shouldn taking himself damn seriously didn actually see him put cross did and his character shouldn such sad sack stands end days just bad movie and awfully gloomy one that

1 |text ladies and gentlemen 1997 independence day here title starship troopers and surprisingly more entertaining than id4 realize that gave last year sci hit star rating but was under the spell the powerful first hour after subsequent viewings feel that independence day really wasn great seemed though still give positive review starship troopers the other hand has mocking sense humor knowing perfectly well how ridiculous may seem result starship troopers more exciting energetic and lively science fiction film fact probably could never get tired watching this film starship troopers very reminiscient star wars another kick ass space opera which reinvented the sci drama altogether while starship troopers star wars comes quite close and the easiest assessment would call this film the star wars the 90s being generous this film perhaps but when science fiction film comes along that can mix humor and romance effectively into the warring races essence this the science fiction equivolence pulp fiction the easiest way write review this film would compare other science fiction films and may have starship troopers not quite original film persay but director paul verhoeven gives the film kick the aliens asses style id4 had this same style except was forced most likely the cause will smith having major role this new star wars has very simple basic plot mankind alien species the alien species question here the bugs seemingly advanced civilization arachnid type insects however the underlying morals starship troopers are fleshed out with deadly accuracy sometimes the morals are buried the bloody violence and intense action scenes but during quiet moments realize that starship troopers has something tell about our civilization more than likely these morals will overpowered and quickly forgotten the time the movie ends and they should doubt verhoeven intended this film thought provoking film this event film but surprisingly above average extremely refreshing watch sci war film and actually root for the human side something independence day never achieved starship troopers begins with satirical portrayal those strange join the army ads mixing web based interface these summations events are refreshingly original stating would you like know more these short news bulletins give the film immediate sense humor and know should not take seriously however also witness the murder several troopers battle gory yet funny way after witnessing the slaughter the film jumps back one year setup what just saw are introduced johnny rico casper van dien and carmen ibanez denise richards rico flirts with carmen sending her messages over computer terminals school classrooms however carmen isn interested rico she becoming pilot however another classmate dizzy flores dina meyer has her eye rico unfortunately rico isn interested dizzy this setup rather cliched the result the setup but still fun watch carmen signs become starship trooper and result rico signs and result dizzy signs everyone assigned certain position the academy carmen gets the pilot position she wanted carl jenkins neil patrick harris psychic gets position the training program and rico left the lowest class the starship troopers the mobile infantry the main story follows rico through his trials and relationships reality found myself watching space version melrose place but with better special effects hour into the film the war begins sense tension grew the audience watched this film with the first hour may have been funny sometimes unintentionally setup but grew care for the flat characters because matter how hard tried not like the characters their gorgeous looks won over call superficial you must following the training sessions which had many dramas themselves too many mention here the troopers are sent war the bugs live the planet klendathu planet which consists dirt and rock and pretty much nothing else many dramas occur during the war until finally the troopers realize that their something behind the bugs attacks sort intelligence which masterminds the defense the troopers are ordered locate the brain and capture hopefully left the plot vague possible because starship troopers not about plot about special effects and gory violence director verhoeven most known for his nudie film showgirls and basic instinct returns his sci days which gave good films like total recall verhoeven likes push the envelope the mpaa but despite all the violence the comic book feel gives the film sense falsehood starship troopers extremely violent with more gore than this year event horizon the rating well deserved and hopefully parents will not allow their year old children see guess that verhoeven target audience the male group the film has testosterone level off the charts with chiseled men and beautiful women despite these superficial elements starship troopers also creates world which made star wars successful while watching the film never second guess the character decisions because they seem perfectly clear thankfully hero punching aliens the face which gives the flat characters some depth for which can identify with the cast starship troopers quite annoying begin with but they soon grow you casper van dien has the chiseled facial features and tan skin which will make most girls swoon most guys will come across artificial fortunately van dien the worst the cast despite how hard tries come off real character dina meyer does much better job fleshing out her character her dizzy extremely likeable denise richards also does good job and her scenes are very well done jake busey gary busey son gives wonderfully funny performance and provides one the biggest laughs the film neil patrick harris remember was doogie howser little wooden and slightly out place with the rest the cast however does give good performance michael ironside gives the best performance the film the teacher with one arm his performance rises above the rest perhaps because his character the most developed but think just ironside presence screen unfortunately particular cast member gives star making performance which too bad because the material here could have made many the cast members stars director verhoeven the main star the film his direction fast and unrelentless never slows down his pace which makes for wild ride writer edward neumeier adapted the screenplay from the book robert heinlein the writing usually very funny and sometimes very corny the dialogue smart but not too smart aren required know everything but some plot holes are left unanswered thankfully are not intended notice and really don except for one which lingered mind for quite while amazingly with all the wars and romance going the screenplay manages include some surprising governmental issues fact these governmental changes seem fairly plausible and this adds another layer the story the moral debate the characters quite surprising find film this genre but what even more surprising the amount humor included into all the carnage haven laughed this loud even some comedies and the special effects are first rate starship troopers rated for graphic sci violence and gore and for some language and nudity believe when say this don take young kids see this film extremely violent fact probably the most violent film out this year however you are old enough over see starship troopers guaranteed entertain been long time since have cheered for the heros while also cheering for the bad guys and still dream see sci film which the alien race destroys mankind and take over the world now that would entertaining
1 |text know that funnest isn word fun noun and therefore cannot conjugated like adjective but that the word that came right after viewing chicken run wonder this the kind movie that reduces you childish expressions like that was the funnest movie ever seen hell with webster chicken run one the funnest movies seen while can remember the last time seen anything funner the chickens tweedy farm are something living concentration camp like atmosphere they are led one plucky hen called ginger voice julia sawalha who continually comes with plans for escape and always gets caught subsequently spending day after day the coal box one night brash american rooster flies over the fence calling himself rocky mel gibson famous flying rooster and circus performer rocky promises teach the chickens how fly and the situation grows more desperate the nefarious mrs tweedy miranda richardson decides abandon the farm egg selling plan for pie selling plan she orders huge pie making machine cackling chickens pies come out what sort pies chicken pies course director nick park and his studio aardman animation produced three oscar winning short films creature comforts the wrong trousers and close shave the latter two were the second and third installments trilogy starring the delightful team wallace gromit man and his dog famous for getting themselves into increasingly peculiar adventures part what made the wallace films brilliantly entertaining was park uncanny ability make old story seem new the wrong trousers for example pulled out lot old hitchcockian suspense tricks and close shave owed great deal inspiration classic detective stories but the hands park and his team the stories felt fresh and inspired and not the least bit contrived now teaming with director peter lord park has created similar creature chicken run the plot largely lifted from the great escape watch for quick reference the ball bouncing scene with some spielberg inspired action sequences providing the excitement thing the film doesn feel like been lifted from somewhere else chicken run feels fresh alive like nothing else ever done part the original idea who the world came with the idea make prisoners war movie starring chickens park and lord milk the incongruity for all worth the characters treat their situation were dead serious and them but they chickens funny another thing that helps chicken run and most park films succeed the animators subtle way giving nods the very films they cribbing there are references the great escape obviously and stalag the chase sequence inside the chicken grinder parodies both raiders the lost ark and indiana jones and the temple doom there even nod the blues brothers you can believe and the filmmakers even get little light hearted ribbing the expense their star voice actor taking couple very subtle jabs mel gibson nationality and film history the braveheart reference hoot you catch when you consider just how fine line resides between funny parody and redundant one chicken run downright brilliant its execution consider this since july last year seen dozens upon dozens blair witch project parodies television the radio and online out all those maybe one two were amusing the rest tiresome why because once you got past the thought that they parodying that blair witch movie most the parodies had nothing offer insight original idea greater purpose they were only funny you had seen the movie otherwise you got nothing conversely chicken run doesn lean its parodies the film references are never the sole focus any scene you never seen indiana jones the chase sequence still fun even you have idea who mel gibson rocky remains interesting character park lord and screenwriter karey kirkpatrick realize that audience does not need parody shoved their faces before understood and result chicken run filled with visual and verbal jabs that are never too obvious but not quite vague either enjoyment this movie doesn require knowledge film history but you got chicken run that much richer the voice cast turns uniformly lively performances and the characters they play are given many subtle nuances that hard not fall love with every one them ginger perfect spunky and opinionated but with soft heart that forbids her leave her companions behind and julia sawalha known the cute mousy girl absolutely fabulous nails she has warm human chemistry with gibson whose rocky hides his personal doubt under brash gung veneer the characters inevitable romance doesn feel contrived but sweet poor tweedy tony haygarth suspects the chickens are organizing some way but his limited intellect prevents him from figuring things out and his overbearing wife certainly isn any help jane horrocks delivers lovely voice characterization tragically optimistic babs hen that runs away with most the best one liners all while perpetually crocheting sweater and two supply trading rats that seem have walked straight out monty python sketch nearly steal the show during the lively central swing dancing sequence they even come with inspired riff something that baffled scholars and theologians alike for decades the chicken egg dilemma one might have expected this inevitable joke come off wearisome but with most chicken run comes delightful surprise the film manages cross all barriers should accessible both children and adults brits and yanks rats and chickens the animation first rate remember that this was all done the old fashioned way with actual humans moving clay figurines around tiny set bit painstaking bit and you see just how truly remarkable chicken run really this movie possesses that same quality that makes pixar studios animation great precise and unwavering attention detail such top notch family fare bug life toy story chicken run has something offer nearly every frame certainly passive viewer can enjoy straightforward story with worthwhile moral and some surprisingly touching scenes but active attentive viewers will enjoy even more because they catch all the details anyway the movie just boatload fun funnest damn movie seen all year

-1 |text you think that these people only exist the movies but trust they real life once talked guy who thought the united states government was putting satellites into orbit which could fry individual person brain with microwaves then sat room full people who believed that the government rigged state elections even listened man who swore that nicotine was additive that cigarette companies put their products for the specific goal getting people addicted these people had what are known conspiracy theories ideas about how unseen forces work deceive and control the public little imagination goes long way richard donner conspiracy theory jerry fletcher mel gibson new york city cab driver who seems have conspiracy theory about everything his latest that nasa trying kill the president causing earthquake from the space shuttle might sound outrageous but all day work for him combs the newspaper looking for tidbits that leave telltale warnings about the goings behind the scenes and from there jerry draws his conclusions upstanding citizen that tries convince alice sutton julia roberts the justice department that the president must warned lucky gal alice who met jerry when saved her from couple muggers and has had listen his theories during the six months since what she doesn know that jerry interest her far more than well professional goes great lengths follow her around and watch her her own apartment but when some secret government types seem take interest jerry ideas and his limited circulation conspiracy theory newsletter finds himself danger and real need alice help one the problems with conspiracy theory that tries pass itself off action thriller when seems have neither whole lot action nor significant number thrills part this result the film slow pace takes forever set the relationship between jerry and alice and even once that over with the rest the film seems lot boredom that every once while stops take break for excitement over two hours this film could have been significantly condensed and had running time shortened twenty minutes half hour but even then the action scenes would not able save the film instead truly exciting and engaging set pieces treated few the generic scenes with the requisite black elements black helicopter men black action suits and body armor black vehicles you know the drill they come down with all kinds neat gadgets and weapons but for some reason guy with just bunch theories and some chick with training somehow manage elude them every time big deal seen all before watching the film wished donner had least tried use little imagination but was out luck now when say took forever set the relationship between jerry and alice completely mean what one person relative the other and not romantic involvement donner and screenwriter brian helgeland would like you believe that the end the movie the two main characters will end falling hopelessly love with each other but there seems evidence that ever occurring you see there were more sparks between gibson and danny glover the lethal weapon movies also directed donner than between gibson and roberts conspiracy theory the two just don click and when you throw number happenings that would cause alice reject jerry altogether like finding out been stalking her the subsequent attraction absolutely forced the script general also seems forced like someone sat helgeland down and forced him write then took and forced upon dialog undistinguished and rather unmemorable the point that almost stopped listening even gibson usual gift for lib couldn punch the film sufficiently raise interest although one jerry theories about oliver stone was mildly amusing unfortunately much what discussed the film not inherently important what going but instead filler that starts out with potential but ends just being extraneous because never followed through for example jerry professes that man found drowned his swimming pool was actually murdered the government new york subway station even goes far explain that the station was flooded the time due water main break hence the water subway station and that the coroner should check the man lungs for chlorine this convincing enough alice that she seems believe him you know what happens then nothing zip nada follow whatsoever what the significance okay here another one couple well known real life assassins were found have possessed copies the salinger novel the catcher the rye jerry also has bunch copies whenever goes into bookstore has buy one leaving out the question whether not this makes jerry assassin never given reason believe why this would make him assassin not when find out about his salinger collection not when goes the bookstore not later when get the answer our first question the point becomes totally extraneous did mention that patrick stewart this film yeah plays this government psychiatrist named jonas who may may not bad guy that about for all the presence this usually marvelous actor has nearly forgettable conspiracy theory you can just lump him with the supporting players with the exception cylk cozart who plays agent lowry the fbi this guy was really likable and wish and his character had gotten more screen time okay here theory this really started out great film but some its jokes were actually true the government came and forced donner make edits for the sake national security and this was what was left over

1 |text seen august 1998 rotterdam square cinemas rotterdam theater myself for free using sony loews critic pass theater rating good seats sound and picture war topic that can help but glorified any way portrayed the media movies documentaries and even history books have way making the darker side humanity exciting since the most general aspects are focused such strategy politics and victory easy forget war its most basic form battle armies out slaughter each other forgotten more easily the fact that each soldier matter what his rank importance real flesh and blood person and not just number saving private ryan one the few films that dares play this aspect especially its unapologetic realistic delivery proves there huge difference between battling and killing the film opens with one the most graphic disturbing scenes recent memory world war day exact and the military invading omaha beach where the nazis are more than ready for them spielberg uses many techniques create for total sense reality instead positioned cameras the footage here seems have been shot camera operators running alongside soldiers they were just scared there sense stability but constant anxious and confusing motion giving the feeling being the middle the battle and just vulnerable the poor troops poor proper word describe how pathetic and yet innocent the men fighting are there little dialogue throughout the loud battle and prologue define any characters don get the feeling these are handsome actors playing heroic roles but that these are men about kill and killed for reasons beyond their understanding the nazis are not portrayed enemies hated but people that must destroyed because they there the movies the good guys can run through firestorm bullets and bombs and not get scratch but reality that wouldn happen the men have nothing shield protect them besides some metal flanks and dead bodies they are sitting ducks and realize this through the perspective the well secured germans who can actually see who what and where they shooting unlike the americans who must fire general direction avoid getting their heads blown off perhaps the film flawed not providing any backstory the war itself and who the men really are but that seems part the theme the film seems rely the audience sense patriotism that the american military right and good and that the nazis are inherently evil the battle scene eventually focuses group men who have miraculously survived and made their way close the enemy stronghold whole foot progression and begin inflict some damage have admit that once the first glimpse victory over the nazis sprang couldn help but feel some sense joy and relief triumph against all odds cliche sure but there nothing cliche about the graphic detailed atmosphere here because really happened one the most surprising aspects the film how little story construction there and yet the events that take place make sense and are interesting the plot practically irrelevant since the film more concerned with the reality the war and the soldiers meet tom hanks stars captain miller relatively average man who happens the leader platoon never obsessive any such generic cartoonish characteristic that might dominate character like this doesn want there any more than his men but when given mission intends carry out the mission the film concerned with the title states saving private ryan through series command started ordinary clerical worker brought general attention that three brothers from iowa have been killed action and their mother will receive notices each death simultaneously when they learn fourth brother stationed somewhere europe they make top priority have him returned safely his mother easy sympathize with this situation after all one should have lose all their children once but finding one man this war miller puts like trying find needle stack needles the saving private ryan isn just dramatic device but thematic one his salvation represents the sense innocence the country the world even was trying convince itself still had when miller company hears the mission they scoff the idea assuming dead but miller isn quick shrug off knows the only thing that can really save soldiers from death hope and now has the opportunity make someone sense hope reality the mission find ryan gives miller group destination but not direction along the way many things happen them both good and bad few battles are fought not major accomplishments for the war but because they encounter german soldiers and have other choice the act killing itself becomes one the film major philosophical metaphors the soldiers don mind killing other soldiers blind battle but when they come across lone survivor who begs them let him they can barely stop themselves from killing him cold blood some kind vengeance for their losses unfortunately death fact war and most films try avoid when comes the main characters but here spielberg doesn want think these men are invincible fact only small amount color and personality sketched into each man and the performances are good enough make this method work although the characters are somewhat typical the actors maintain control over the material all time whether they arguing with each other telling stories back home fighting the germans they never overboard and always seem believable sure there zinger here and there but war doesn change the fact boys will boys and when one dies too can feel the loss even though hardly knew them the final act brings the story full circle with another tremendous violent battle sequence private ryan has been found but facing four one odds can the americans defeat the germans and keep ryan alive that not premise for thrills symbolic everything the film has

1 |text most people fit into two different categories you either love woody allen you hate his guts family for the most part hates him and his movies think very funny but his shtick has gotten forced and contrived over the years maybe taking his body away was the best decision any producer could have thought unrestrained physical boundaries allen humor comes shining through those who had problems with his physical appearance will able join the rest laughing allen intelligent observations life those who had problems with his verbal comedy may want skip this one 1995 film was introduced audiences which sparked their imaginations and showed them something they never seen before toy story used state the art computer technology and presented world toys who would come alive when humans were present many critics will call that better film but believe they only say that because was completely original motion picture antz however has upped the ante considerably disney bug life isn due out for another two months and dreamworks seems have received the better end the deal beating disney out they have satisfied the audience thirst for computer animated films but don let that fool you disney definitely not scared the past two years competitions have broken out between studios 1997 was the volcano duel opinion dante peak came out way ahead its predecessor both time and quality volcano had original premise but destroyed that with some very ridiculous situations 1998 there are twice many competing films first was the comet competition and armageddon blew away cheesily dramatic competitor deep impact but now even more interesting one beloved studio disney goes against the newcomer dreamworks who will prevail time will tell but sure that mouse has nothing fear this may sound like didn like antz the contrary put there with toy story but due rating many parents may put off some the dialogue which shouldn appear disney version some the dialogue antz pushes the envelope for family oriented film sexual innuendoes and profanity pop occasionally which makes dreamworks animated feature geared more for adult crowd the humor also written especially for adults though many kids were laughing the theater attended this the type film that should made for families more often entertaining for kids and entertaining for parents antz begins with hilarious monologue which seems meld between woody allen shtick and franz kafka metamorphosis the short story man who wakes discover himself bug allen troubled ant believing was not made worker when you the middle child family five million comments about his neglected childhood one night sitting bar with his friend weaver sylvester stallone discussing his pathetic place life walks princess bala sharon stone whom one recognizes without crown bala asks would like dance and they engage pulp fiction esque dance while everyone else following the leader after discovering that she the princess falls love but there problem bala getting married general mandible gene hackman ruthless leader who merely wants control better and stronger colony order that must eliminate not only the queen anne bancroft but the weakest the colony namely the worker ants but get rid the queen needs get rid the loyal army ants who would willing die for her and colonel cutter christopher walkin come with plan send the loyal ants off battle where they will surely killed the queen reluctant first but decides best for the colony meanwhile wants meet bala again and asks weaver army ant switch places with him gets sent off battle but manages survive the slaughter the termites the battle sequence absolutely stunning though you may have flashbacks starship troopers which contained very similar sequence however antz and that 1997 film were both production around the same time the similarities are merely coincidence the second half the film revolves around kidnapping bala and their search for mythical place called insectopia there ant can his own boss and have all the food wants the adventures and bala get into are surprisingly high tension especially one involving magnifying glass looming over the targets like the spaceships from independence day fact just going assume that the producers referenced id4 intentionally the ants look awe and then beam fire blasts into the ground visually exciting rush adrenaline but don fooled little kids shouldn see this they may just try and copy after seeing antz vowed never intentionally step ant again hopefully children will learn that killing ants rather cruel animated film antz probably the best you will find date visually stunning what dreams may come the best aspect animation the fact that the characters aren limited gravity they can take ridiculous situations and make them seem plausible one great moment involves mass worker ants bunching form wrecking ball the animation perfect that you can virtually see every single ant the ball however the most exhilarating scene involves bala getting stuck the bottom young boy shoe truly great example film making its finest with computer technology the animators have carefully made the ants faces look similar the actors providing the voices the best example would have barbatus danny glover one point you can even see the pores his face although doubt ants have pores they barbatus also has touching but rather gruesome scene has his final words with without body young kids may disturbed the site dismembered head but good deal humor derived more appropriate for adults course disney bug life looks good but don know they will able best dreamworks newest animated feature terms animation not then dreamworks will have done something other studio could head head with the big mouse and knock him down yes anastasia was good but not nearly good even the worst disney vocal talent always essential animated feature and antz has one the best line ups seen since toy story fact far exceeds that one woody allen has always been funny but here transcends most what done the past few years without body his comic timing the most noticeable thing fact pretty sure that the writers let him improvise lot his lines sharon stone bala shows off some her comic ability though for the most part stone works best dramatic actress sylvester stallone teamed with stone once again beginning solidify his statement that wants actor not typecast action star after snub the oscars last year stallone proving himself the serious comedic illustrated here actor that gene hackman superb the gruff talking general almost doing another take his crimson tide persona christopher walkin probably more noticed his voice and many people will remember him from such hits batman returns anne bancroft has minimal role but she effective nonetheless danny glover has small role but does very very good job dan aykroyd and jane curtin also lend their voices two lovesick euro trash bees both are very unrecognizable especially aykroyd jennifer lopez plays worker ant who falls love with weaver although most people won recognize her voice either many people will recognize grant shaud voice the foreman played miles the show murphy brown this definitely huge cast with some high profile names and will definitely help grosses course you can probably tell where lot the million budget went also directors eric darnell and lawrence guterman are relative newcomers though guterman did direct 1994 feature headless but both show incredible talent for this type picture tense times and very funny throughout the two hold this film together like professionals the screenplay todd alcott and chris weitz quite simple plot but contains lot subtlety that makes the film more suitable for adults kids will delight the animation while parents can laugh heartily the humor most will over young children heads does that mean you shouldn take kids see not all they will have lot fun watching this one what great the themes that are given part social commentary part romance story and part moral drama antz gives everyone something talk about whether the animation the discussions individualism and community thankfully not subtle either aspects antz rated for mild language and some intense action sometimes the language can pushing the limits for family movie but the violence what should keep kids home the battle scene has ants melting acid and bugs being speared death and the magnifying scene shows ant disintegrate the beam sunlight but other than that and some sexual innuendos perfect choice for some wholesome fun the theaters doubt many children will understand the sexual innuendos unless they are old enough but still advisable leave really young children home have confused you enough you take your kids recommend seeing the film with them because more than likely you enjoy the most

1 |text there are certain people the world who have some talent that very few people have but they chose not take advantage this for some personal reason good will hunting about one those people the will hunting the horrible title let face this film would bitch title played writer matt damon mathematical genius can almost any mathematical connundrum about the time takes brew cup irish cream cappuccino and works mit the janitor one day the professor one the most challenging courses proffessor lambeau breaking the waves stellan skarsg puts big problem the board for his students attempt complete the next day already done the board but one his class claims have done lambeau puts another problem the board this time one that took and his colleagues over two years prove and duh done again course they catch the guy who did red handed will before lambeau can find will again ran away when caught him will has gotten into fight with bunch punks basketball court and struck police officer lambeau gets him out probation with two agreements work with him math and get some therapy after going through some therapists whom psyches out one way another for hypnotist fakes being under his spell then launches into impromptu performance the 70s classic afternoon delight finally lambeau old college roomate sean mcguire robin williams psych professor agrees treat him and the two begin rocky relationship sean tries get will open turns out will had rough childhood being abandoned and placed foster homes and what not also turns out that will does not want simple mathematics all his life wants challenge and that hang out with his buds including the other writer ben affleck and honorable jobs like construction right make this genius follow the footsteps einstein and kasinsky should this guy forced something doesn want this appears one the million questions this film which jam packed with greatness but does not have the totally brilliant whole should not saying good will hunting bad film all very enjoyable film with tons great moments and lots great things about the acting amazing with two oscar nomination worthy performances from damon and williams who have amazing chemistry together also get some great support from stellan skarsg great name ben affleck and from minnie driver who plays will love interest skylar there are tons individual moments that adored loved all the comedy the film especially scene where damon proves schmuck out college student who quoting historian impress some chicks his various attempts therapy and course favorite scene the entire film the one where delivers long exstensive rant some nsa agents about the downside working for them liked the relationship between some the people like will and skylar will and sean sean and lambeau and will and his friends there are scenes between them which are just amazing watch and there are even moments the film which are honest their portrayal that felt rightfully uncomfortable like the break scene between will and skylar will and sean first meeting bar scene between sean and lambeau and scene where sean tells detail how doesn regret meeting his first wife who would later suffer slow painful death and leave him lonely and slightly bitter however the main flaw the film there too much everything and not enough either the film tries for deeper relations between the characters but they sometimes either overwritten underwritten take for example the relationship between sean and will the film gets interesting father son well doctor patient relationship going with out any problems but when tries show them equals falls its face hear how they went the same town and there are even scenes where the film shows how hypocritical both them are times but this never takes off like the other parts their relationship also will relationship with his best friend chuckie affleck has nice climax but not enough rising action see them joking around but when chuckie arrives decision between the two them seems more like superficial reasoning than more selected one their relationship never goes beyond just best friends and his decision just seems generalization any two best friends instead something more human maybe was just and also goes for parallelism with the relationship between sean and lambeau but that again underwritten and course most films like this the girl boy relationship pretty underwritten never understand what they see each other when skylar confesses that she loves him seems more like there for plot details that anything else minnie driver interesting though and breathes life into her character the writing bit fault here but what makes all this worthwhile the little moments the film where acheives true awesomeness sure feels overstuffed but extremely enjoyable the dialogue that affleck and damon have written amazingly fresh and seems extremely human think that they should get nomination for their script chiefly because the dialogue which amazing

seen don feel qualified make such judgment but say this without hesitation raging bull great motion picture and would surprised more than handful films released between january 1980 and december 1989 come close its level bio pics often fall into one two categories overblown hero worship dry dull textbook account rare that movie with the moniker based the life comes across anything more than sporadically energetic and marginally entertaining raging bull the perfect counterexample and brilliant argument for film makers continue work this genre the picture takes the life boxer jake motta middleweight icon from the 40s and 50s and develops one the most compelling character studies ever reach the big screen for all 129 minutes director martin scorsese and actor robert niro the title role have mesmerized this individual who turns sympathetic sad and horrifying historically raging bull said mostly accurately with the lion share the details culled from motta own autobiography which was written with joseph carter and peter savage however although motta credited the movie consultant was reportedly unhappy with the final result because portrays him nothing short uncouth insensitive lout the motta the movie man extreme appetites who driven base bestial impulses paranoia jealousy and blind rage sex and violence are inextricably linked the title apt motta raging bull the ring

championship match meanwhile away from the ring motta falls love with year old vicki who marries after discarding his shrewish first wife vicki becomes jake greatest prize wife his view not companion but possession and the source his most extreme pain his own insecurity great that cannot accept that woman beautiful vicki could faithful him hence constantly haunted belief that she sleeping with someone else perhaps even his brother this leads the famous line parodied waiting for guffman and elsewhere are you king wife the late 40s motta gets his first shot championship fight but with one huge condition must take fall does badly that investigation launched and almost thrown out boxing two years later wins the championship only lose subsequent bout sugar ray the late 50s and early 60s

deconstruction motta the man never backs away from showing the seedy ugly underside sport where gambling greed and organized crime force fighters throw matches continue working rocky shows boxing its noblest raging bull shows its most diseased there little can say here that hasn already said about niro performance career that has included many fine roles this his most outstanding the level intensity niro brings motta unwavering and although there lot travis bickle niro character taxi driver motta scorsese and niro great lengths make sure that never fully sympathize with him least understand the forces that drive him this complete characterization and perfect example acting the younger jake niro trim and fit the fat older man niro gained pounds and turned his body into grotesque parody its normal form how many actors would that far the best oscar statue only one testimony the lasting power the performance cathy moriarty and joe pesci both earned nominations for

love has turned into fear scorsese and cinematographer michael chapman elected shoot the bulk raging bull black and white few home movie segments are color the choice perfect for the movie giving raging bull unique look era when black and white approach almost unheard one important recent exception schindler list eschewed color for some the same reasons that raging bull did black and white especially considering scorsese choice shots and use slow motion the violence stark and disturbing there room for romanticism the ring with inky black blood staining the canvas during fight sequences the director also uses number point view shots designed show the world however briefly from motta perspective scorsese could have chosen end the film with motta loss sugar ray where surrendered his middleweight crown after that his career was all downhill yet the director allows the film run for thirty minutes after this pivotal moment stretching more than decade into motta future the reason obvious scorsese isn interested boxing the character following his retirement motta still violent and volatile ever but has lost the arena which can legally unleash those tendencies see the results this beast let loose society and how the consequences his actions reduce him parody his former self who cannot feel surge pity for motta quietly recites marlon brando speech from the waterfront coulda

1 |text john cusack the kind actor who seems effortlessly slide into his respective film roles effortlessly that people tend forget there much the way people rarely recall many the great character actors anyone who can put the name james rebhorn with that actor face invited treat themselves product from one sponsors example the other day mother asked the expert course there were any movies out worth seeing never mind that our tastes couldn more divergent never forget the day she recommended that see night the roxbury for god sakes and fair she was mightily pissed for telling her that was lot fun which didn see this anything more than futile attempt conversation muttered with little trepidation that she might enjoy high fidelity she responded with her usual query whose that one this question whose answer that seems immediately conjure the kind movie you went see the reply julia roberts you probably assume was something wispy and light sylvester stallone movie and you picture bloodbath with few words and much involuntary bicep flexing and woody allen movie means hyper articulate white people usually the jewish faith fretting about some upper east side palace anyway when answered john cusack she replied with rather stunned who was unreasonable for her know whom was referring now know for fact that mother has seen several cusack movies most recently being john malkovich and pushing tin but suppose understandable that she would not recognize the name after all for most names are tougher than faces showed her picture cusack mug the paper hoping for him yes quite good instead got don know him this point was way beyond frustration into realm nose hair yanking anger yes filmic ignorance all takes get into the nose hair pulling zone till realized something doubt that much america would recognize cusack relatively bland visage even the name which rather bland compared the coolness brad pitt tom cruise one syllable names that glide off the tongue with the velocity speeding car sack sack not quite cool sure that twenty years from now cusack will forever referred the guy from add the cusack film your choice not brand name and his movies usually aren big moneymakers but his own unassuming way kind genius with his pleasant common man looks and charming semi articulate blatherings has become one the most likeable romantic leading men the from the sure thing say anything cusack has merged the talents early tom hanks and early jack lemmon despite the fact that nearly every character plays variation the character before the schlumpy every man constantly enjoyable screen persona like albert brooks woody allen and knows how chose scripts while the stephan baldwin and val kilmer seem put them selves everything the former actually had the insight follow oscar winner usual suspects with pauly shore vehicle and judging from his latest projects looks like still has yet fire his agent cusack generally picks rewarding projects save for the unwatchable hot pursuit 1988 film also featuring young ben stiller high fidelity his second collaboration with hit miss english director stephan fears the grifters the country and hit was also written cusack and some his collaborators the terrific comedy grosse point blank not quite entertaining funny that film but progresses its meandering fashion the movie cast something spell over high fidelity begins hipster ode the non committal rob vinyl record store owner who opens the film breaking down the fourth wall with much abandon and educating his top break ups list this something cusack does the entire film ferris bueller day off first the talking directly into the camera schtick had vaguely annoyed mostly because reminded much the film body shots which used similar conceit but began grow due almost entirely cusack witty delivery the kind guy don mind talking directly gradually the film settles into shampoo like tragi comic character study guy who must confront himself and his personal failures order figure out the true person yes all very existential though that plot line mostly enjoyable the thing liked the most about the film how much pleasure offers introducing minor characters all whom now this really something are terrific enough warrant their own films the best which jack black the very funny show tenacious program that sadly went the way bruce willis hair unfortunately that annoying smirk remains ardent record store employee who bullies customers into buying exactly what wants them buy the kind guy sure all met before blowhard who thinks always right and will anything his power yell argue insult hoist his opinion onto others but like this guy because how black plays him the actor portly with round baby face and crazy eyes but despite his size leaps and fro like manic speed freak which might bit redundant description seeing how all the speed freaks know are manic the kind supporting character who would impossibly annoying comic relief most other films look what that hack jan bont did poor phillip seymour hoffman twister but fears and black never let that happen the character for all his shucking and jiving steeped reality over the top but way can all probably relate catherine zeta jones her brief role gives vivid portrayal women completely enamored with her own charm tim robbins registers even tinier part new age type character played entirely for cartoon yuks but still manages work its desired comic effect the one exception the acting department bit doozy the main love interest played danish actress iben hjejle mifune who completely obliterates any trace danish accent replacing with stilted american phonation give her kudos for attempting such contradictory role but instead being likeable she comes across rather robotic and such hard see why cusack character would obsessed with her especially when has beautiful intelligent writer natasha gregson wagner potentially waiting the wings this reminded say anything where the charming cusack was paired with the charmless ione skye and midnight the garden good and evil where the poor bastard had put with alison eastwood whose unbelievably more wooden then father clint for those special people whose wheels turn little slower fact cusack rarely paired with personality that matches his though bet that laura and natasha switched roles the result would more effective high fidelity works almost entirely the strength its characters and performances fears direction somewhat stilted and the script sometimes little too and this word beginning hate use but alas must quirky for its own good think blame that scott rosenberg who judging from what did with beautiful girls con air and things denver while your dead has his fingerprints all over the most irritating bits this movie but cusack really does deserve award for being damn cusackian afraid that his talents are understated that may have wait till his hip needs replacing offered such award worthy his considerable talent his character rob whose sort like older more bitter lloyd from say anything funny and tragic without being pathetic and that cusack can all this and still not imprint himself onto the minds most audiences something achievement

1 |text actually fan the original 1961 live action disney flick the same name starring hayley mills twice pair twins separated birth divorcing parents never come contact with the other the parents never have meet again and everyone should know how feel about remakes especially films happen enjoy fallacy unless you going either capture the same exact spirit the original something different with maybe even both just wrack your brain and come with gasp new idea this remake was not originally the top viewing list and was actually quite the opposite contemporary live action disney films are not one favorties anyway they usually unfunny alienating and big fat bore least anyone over the age and above the this one however shockingly not bad fact actually good not the original good but what great about that doesn necessarily retread the original capture the same exact spirit does become entertaining for the same exact reasons the original was entertaining because cute and innocent fun because has pretty killer plot that endlessly fun follow along with because the lead star immensely appealing because the parents are also immensely appealing and repeating myself because cute and innocent fun there nothing too risque about save the plot the idea separating twins and denying them the truth for years ominously selfish but that precisely the point the movie and aimed directly either kids adults who want remember the original young adults who want remember what was like kid personally somewhere between the second and third can vividly remember when taste movies wasn weird diverse the names godard and kubrick weren even glimmer right eye back then when would tune every sunday night for couple years see abc wonderful world disney where they show you live action and made for disney flick hour per week can remember mom taking sister and along with all friends and their mothers see all the rereleased disney films like lady and the tramp and pinnochio and most sadly remember every single christmas without fail there were barage children animated half hour shows made exclusively for the christmas season that wouldn dare missing can even remember seeing the made for parent trap one night and after had seen that one over and over and over again saw the original parent trap more late childhood movie because deals with the issue divorce but deals with disney ized version playful and witty and charming and saw for the first time right now having never experienced that part childhood probably dismiss probably the same for the new version the same movie hadn seen the original such perfect age watching could remember what fun was watch disney film and how divorce for started get thinking about the possibilities seemingly perfect parents splitting and how affected adolescence and also how brushed that fear off with smooth stroke and pointed out that even the most fucked situations things could always work out you well manipulate things bit least for the better this new version did that for but also charming its own way has new cast contemporary feel and for the first time awhile for live action disney flick tone that isn corny condescending but just right the moments that would otherwise seem corny are actually affecting safe kind way and for the first time since the original film the kids actually know better than the foolish adults the story basically classic now repeated almost many times kurosawa the seven samurai pair twins played here lindsay lohan just like they were played hayley mills the original are separated birth their divorcing parents one annie sent live with the mother natasha richardson resembling her mother vanessa redgrave more than had ever noticed london where she lives with her parents and her devoted foppish butler simon kunz she works swingin fashion designer she grows refined and classy but also with keen knowledge sports and poker playing the other hallie sent northern california with her father dennis quaid live vineyard with their pseudo maid lisa ann walter and grows rugged yet charming they both meet the same camp one that annie wants become more rugged they feud because they look all too similar and are thus tight competition which results some nasty pranks which winds them seclusion together private out the way cabin there they become friends then learn about eachother once they know everything they concoct scheme switch places the one can meet the other parent whom they only heard they learn about eachother lives detail they make sure they look alike which requires hair cutting and notoriously ear piercing scene which like the kiddie version the hypodermic needle scene pulp fiction and when the end summer comes they switch and hope for the best lindsay lohan doesn necessarily copy the acting style hayley mills the original but she comes off just appealing she did once she does though add couple new things she makes the california twin little more appealing and the london twin bit more frank and snobbish than the snotty and proper original respectively she also adds american and british accent each one with one faking the other accent throughout and you really take notice you can see that the fake ones accents aren exactly perfect she also incredibly appealing not merely cute which especially notable since this her first feature film and know how notorious child actors are especially their first films she makes great protagonist and only helps that the supporting cast equally appealing dennis quaid fact hasn been this likable about decade his big dumb smile and near cocky attitude what has made him notable actor the past not just that meg ryan ditto natasha richardson except that she just hasn ever been this likable period the two make winning couple maybe not winning maureen hara and the late brian keith the original but they still work for this film instead the bickering that ensued the original the film adds another dimension and another angle their characters that was amiss the original during the opening credits see glimpses from their courtship the qe2 where they fall quickly and madly love with eachother and when back together again the film more smarmy scenes come off actually sentimental but that great way not the migraine inducing way many such films this all brings this new parent trap level entertainment that hasn really existed since well the original film years ago still money the best live action disney flick all time this because has form intelligence and wit that makes such plot points otherwise standard villainous love interest subplot gold digging sharon stone type played elaine hendrix who deliciously tormented the twins later the film treat instead bore like the original this film transcends all the crap that very well could case point takes two starring the olsen twins because treats the children the smart ones and the adults the silly ones not the other way around and because above everything knows exactly how charming without biting off more than can chew however comparison with the original could bit better certain scenes work well but not nearly well they worked the original liked the way the parents fought over past dilemnas and then fought over falling love again better than liked watching two old flames getting back together over bottle wine somehow feuding always more cinematic and pleasing than mere reminscing lesson extracted from the howard hawks cary grant films yesteryear and much this film transcends mere cutedom compared the original this film almost drowns cutedom the original though not gritty was far more stylized and just suitable for adult audiences was for young audiences such this remake may never nearly great classic the original film but least knows how treat its source material with dignity and respect and how create virtually the same effects without bordering plagerism petty annoyances

his murder his own brother hands hamlet enlisting the help his friend horatio conspires capture the conscience the new king expose his treachery and the game afoot the first things you notice about this production are the sets and costumes with external scenes filmed blemheim palace england also the one the sites for the recent the avengers the grandiose quality the setting immediately established interior scenes are similarly graced with intricate and flamboyant rooms and chambers the hamlet castle grand throne room impressive piece work incorporating high ceilings mirror panel doors and bridges which connect opposite sides second story loft costuming equally grand drawing upon both history and imagination not quite the denmark the 1600 the characters attire something cross between that era and turn the century russia very effectively giving the film more timeless feel not surprising that tim harvey and alexandra byrne were nominated for best art direction and best costume design oscars respectively addition directing kenneth branagh also plays the title character the revenge driven royal heir branagh provides riveting performance emotional highs and lows from the anticipation seeing his father ghost the melancholy finding the burial site his childhood jester his eventual wrath branagh delivers spades every scene truly revolves around hamlet much tribute branagh acting and directing shakespeare manuscript hamlet seems who who shakespearean trained actors watching them perform the craft for which they have much love delight itself julie christie hamlet

cases this made for interesting scenes billy crystal surprisingly good the gravedigger who unearths the skull yorick whom hamlet knew quite well crystal proves himself able deliver the lines with both

actor wish branagh had chosen allow envision our own minds the scene which heston lays out and let the venerable actor have the attention unfortunately there were some casting choices which led poor distractions jack lemmon excellent actor just can shakespeare marcellus the guard who sees the elder hamlet ghost lemmon sadly underperforms and shown left and right those around him gerard depardieu

-1 |text john boorman zardoz goofy cinematic debacle fundamentally misconceived and laughably executed that takes bizarre enjoyment quality all its own not since the rampant bumblings one edward wood has movie been silly and serious the same time course wood career can explained two things had money and had talent boorman the other hand cannot court such excuses explain zardoz his follow film the equally awful exorcist the heretic boorman obviously had sizable budget matinee idol movie star sean connery the lead role and although you wouldn know from this film boorman does indeed have talent this the man who made the slick modern masterpiece deliverance 1972 well the autobiographical world war drama hope and glory 1987 the slightly over conceived arthurian epic excalibur 1981 and the father son jungle adventure the emerald forest 1985 his films all show that boorman never lacking imagination but sometimes that comes the cost coherence and taste boorman anything ambitious and when succeeds grand fashion unfortunately the bigger they are the harder they fall and when boorman falls the resounding impact can heard for miles around zardoz meant takes its place among the grandest mystical movies obsession boorman his screenplay tries elicit the same mythological connotations the arthurian legends even the wizard book which figures into the movie plot but despite all this reaching the resulting movie more unintentionally funny than intentionally enigmatical compelling the events take place the distant year 2293 but there little the typical futuristic movie ness found fact things seems have moved backwards with people riding horses shooting old style guns and living large victorian mansions more middle ages than space age the world zardoz divided into two distinct hemispheres the outlands where all the poor pathetic people live and the vortex where select group wealthy intellectuals live comfort and everlasting life these immortals never grow old they never engage sexual activity they possess psychological powers and they live sort quasi utopian marxist society where everyone equal and everyone contributes equally the society however one breaks the rules that person punished being aged many years someone breaks the rules enough she aged the point senility and imprisoned eternal existence geriatric home with others aged criminals one the immortals arthur frayn niall buggy squirmy man with mustache and goatee tattooed his face charged with keeping order the outlands and forcing the residents farm the immortals can fed like the wizard adopts god like status among the people flying their part the world giant stone carved like menacing head this flying head one the movie opening images and dead giveaway the lunacy come calling himself zardoz frayn gathers bunch outlanders and makes them into group called the exterminators whose purpose kill most the other outlanders they can procreate and take more resources from inside his giant stone head zardoz bellows seriously laugh inducting statements like the gun good the penis evil that line alone worth the movie cult following one day exterminator named zed sean connery sneaks into zardoz flying stone pushes frayn out and goes back the vortex once there the immortals label him brutal and study him like lab rat taking great perverse care exploring his sexuality which mystery them they seem especially interested his ability gain erection and there one downright hilarious sequence where bunch scantily clad female scientists show zed erotic footage video screen attempt determine what gets him worked say hilarious because that exactly what zardoz obvious that boorman did not intend made this film with the straightest faces although have hard time believing that production moved forward didn get even the slightest inkling how patently ridiculous was becoming just looking connery enough give one the giggles spends most the film running around red loin cloth that resembles diaper mane hair braided halfway down his back wyatt earp style handlebar mustache and pair thigh high patent leather boots that would look more appropriate cheap hollywood hooker boorman made the film right after the critical and financial success deliverance which the only reason can imagine studio would green light this effort attracted some rich talent both sides the camera including cinematographer geoffrey unsworth 2001 whose striking visuals are about the only good thing zardoz besides the inadvertent humor sean connery had made his last james bond film 1971 and perhaps was looking for change pace got exactly that zardoz and wonder didn end his career sure boorman intended for this movie make some grand statements treatise about the infallibility eternal life condemnation those who consider growing old bad thing social statement something about the inherent negativity class distinctions and the violence creates karl marx might like were more like timothy leary come think maybe boorman made extended lsd trip people high illicit substances are the only ones can imagine enjoying this asinine silliness anything more than completely unintentional comedy
1 |text when initially set out review this film tag line was going you too can believe whales can fly then was going you too can believe pastel triangles can fly then was going you too can believe wood sprites can fly finally just gave trying come with tag line and decided say there lot flying going this film our first host steve martin tells the original concept behind fantasia was bring out every year with some old segments retained and some new segments added well apparently that plan fell the wayside for while because approximately sixty years have passed since the original classic was released part this might have something with the cold reception the film got when was first released 1940 grossing somewhere close 110 000 its original month release subsequent releases the film have elevated the popularity the film the classic status has finally achieved and rightfully deserved celebrate the release updated version fantasia disney and imax teamed present the animated film fashion one had seen before six stories high exclusive four month engagement from january 1st april 30th 2000 fantasia 2000 can seen many imax theaters across the after the engagement over the film will shown regular theaters the format effective for the film with few exceptions yes the first segment are presented with set beethoven fifth symphony hard describe exactly what this segment about but involves bunch brightly colored butterfly looking triangles flitting about happily everything seems going great for these little things until the ground erupts with swarms evil black bat like triangles that attack and engulf their lighter counterparts eventually shafts light from above help drive away the evil bat like things and peace returns the butterfly things though this segment isn very story driven some the images are very visually strong especially the scene which the dark cloud bat things who are all outlined blood red colors begin overtake the skies the next segment set ottorino respighi the pines rome this segment some humpback whales swim happily through the ocean and eventually emerge from the water and fly around the massive icebergs that pepper the oceanscape whale calf gets into scuffle with some nearby birds during the flight and ends getting trapped giant iceberg smashes into while trying avoid the birds attack finally saved another liberating shaft light and and his brethren take the skies and fly into the upper atmosphere where they frolic the oceans clouds again visuals are the key with this segment especially where the whales are involved reportedly the whales viewed imax screen certain sequences are shown actual size the cgi whales look incredibly life like except for some googly cartoon eyes drawn onto the images one especially striking image involves the giant shadow one the whales being cast through the wall iceberg the whale calf tries find way out its parent absolutely beautiful stuff the third segment and the least the eight segments set george gershwin rhapsody blue this segment designed tribute acclaimed caricaturist hirschfeld and intertwines four different stories about sad souls living depression era new york there construction worker who dreams being jazz drummer out work sad sack that dreams having job young girl that dreams spending time with her parents instead being hustled off schoolmarm and nebbish who dreams being free from his overbearing wife won into how everything works out but fine disney tradition there happy ending unfortunately the story drags quite bit and the seems out place within the hyper reality the rest the segments segment four set dmitri shostakovich piano concerto and animated version hans christian andersen the steadfast tin soldier one legged toy tin soldier falls love with wind clock ballerina whom assumes also one legged because can see her other leg extended out behind her much the dismay evil jack the box jester the jester knocks the soldier out window and continues pursuing the ballerina little does the jester know the soldier has been deposited the sewer and has journeyed through the pipelines only swallowed fish that has been captured and sold the owner the set tin soldiers that the one legged one comes from the soldier eventually saves the day and gets the girl although the ending has been altered from the andersen story the steadfast tin soldier decently told with the framework seven minute short some children may find the jester little frightening but otherwise the segment well made segment five the funniest the bunch set camille saint saens the carnival the animals this segment features flamingo torturing his fellow flamingos with while they are trying perform choreographed dance number while the shortest clip the group and throwback the alligators and hippos dancing the first fantasia still well accomplished and welcome bit comedy segment six the only segment repeated from the original 1940 fantasia and the one that people remember most the sorcerer apprentice the story the most recognizable the draw here seeing the enormous imax screen remastered stereo unfortunately the segment wasn made presented large format film considering was shot full frame and exhibits large amounts grain there were least two occasions where images were very hard make out due the excessive grain similar problems crop modern day releases when projected screens too large for the image shown accurately but one seems notice for some strange reason anomaly common many plus screen theaters segment seven set sir edward elgar pomp and circumstance march and the only other fantasia segment feature stock disney character donald duck stars assistant noah whose task loading all the animals onto the ark during the loading donald and his wife lose sight each other and both believe that the other one didn make the boat they are constantly missing each other due comic misadventures mainly involving donald being crushed animals various manners despite the slapstick style comedy this piece displays more emotion its final scene than many the tear jerkers foisted audiences these days powerful stuff segment eight brings whole new meaning the clich saving the best for last set igor stravinsky the firebird elk awakens forest sprite that proceeds change the wintery landscape into beautiful springtime landscape trees bloom and flowers blossom and everything seems going well until the sprite becomes inquisitive about large mountain housing strange formation when the sprite examines the formation awakens and becomes the titular firebird stunning spectacle the firebird rears back and unleashes and fire storm that destroys everything its path including everything that the sprite has worked create some amazing animation present here and well worth the ten dollars ticket alone although brush strokes are evident one scene due the enlargement the film the host segments are largely pun intended throwaways although steve martin clip pretty funny sure stay through the credits for little more humor from martin penn and teller are usually funny but here their gags seem routine and therefore uninteresting the best segment comes from all people bette midler who gets tell about some the abandoned segments that never made off the drawing board pieces like flight the bumblebee take the four horsemen set wagner ride the valkyries and strange segment prepared the 40s salvador dali that never was shown are all previewed here and teased that they may appear future installments for fans visual stimulation classical music fantasia 2000 perfect way spend the afternoon the film also decent family entertainment and contains little objectionable material mentioned earlier the review ten dollars seems like too much for you spend this film fear not because after its run imax theaters going brought out regular theaters must stress that the best way see this film imax screen though then you too can believe that whales triangle things sprites can fly

with the camera obvious from the terrific tracking shot throughout nightclub which opens the film and introduces the players through the showy sequence the camera follows female partygoer diving into

impertinent and self congratulatory case point marc rocco unforgettable perpetual motion helming murder the first boogie nights every zoom pan anderson slow and deliberate energetically sharp purposeful and potent rarity and delight discover such confidently assured work early filmmaker career boogie nights only his second feature film following his debut feature from earlier this year hard eight and although somewhat derivative his storytelling style reminiscent robert altman while terms visuals clearly influenced martin scorsese least borrowing from some the best and entirely effective within the context this film while boogie nights astonishingly polished from technical perspective terms sheer entertainment value also rollicking good fun with wickedly deadpan sense humour the film perfectly captures the essence the disco period terms music clothes hairstyles dance idioms and culture aided immeasurably impeccable production design bob ziembicki and costume design mark bridges and boogie nights convincingly catapults the audience back this recent pre aids scare period american history where uninhibited free wheeling lifestyles abounded while much the film humour pertains the characters obliviousness now outdated aspects their lives then prevalent society prime example part time salesman buck swope demo stereo system with eight track tape and inviting prospective customer get freaky deaky with the music elicited with undercurrent not ridicule but wistful reminiscence and some the throwback elements the film are strangely wondrous giant ensemble

farrah fawcett cheryl tiegs bruce lee breathtaking ably supported well selected collection period music all which purportedly came straight from anderson personal collection there clear affection for the era boogie nights the period aspect and the playfully comic nostaligism boogie nights which has been played its marketing campaign deference the pornography element the storyline the film promotional trailer markedly avoids any explicit reference the adult film industry which unites its characters after the debacle with 1996 milos forman film the people larry flynt another finely crafted work which was knocked off the market prematurely due controversy regarding its pornography related storyline the new line marketing team faced unique challenge with boogie nights terms attempting deemphasize the relatively risque erotic picture element the story order increase salability the general public however while boogie nights delves into the world the adult film industry two decades ago hardly lurid seamy film given the subject matter there very little nudity and virtually none can construed gratuitous and boogie nights smartly depicts erotic filmmaking not hotbed carnality but simply business the glimpses the sets jack horner shoots reveal that while the films makes are intended titillate there candid matter factness terms sex his cast and crew are professionals who are merely doing job and refreshing that the obvious cliches depravity and sinful lechery often linked dismissive portraits adult filmmaking such coercion debauchery are avoided anything boogie nights more interested the process adult filmmaking than the adult films themselves jack horner dream honourable one genuinely aspires make great film and some degree boogie nights reminiscent wood albeit lacking certain wistful innocence both films the world quickie low budget filmmaking explored and both jack horner and the version wood tim burton scott alexander and larry karaszewski share similar mindsets jack retort there are shadows light baby his cinematographer complaint about poor set lighting echoes back wood not about the little details about the big picture rant when pointed out that his graveyard set for plan from outer space appears patently false boogie nights and wood the aspirations the respective filmmakers prove bemusing not their intentions there nothing inherently silly the goal making artistic erotic picture but the degree that they miss the mark much like the humour lacing wood the laughs involving jack horner are double edged after viewing hilarious excerpt from one his latest films which hybridizes the james bond and porn genres when jack breathes this the best work ever done genuinely funny but given his utter sincerity also possesses tinge sadness anderson this point clearly greater talent director than screenwriter while boogie nights shows great inventiveness staging there really isn any clever dialogue the film though valid point certainly can made that none the film characters particularly lend themselves thoughtful verbal exchanges when one considers that the film protagonist literally doesn say single insightful thing throughout the entire 152 minute running time wonder why the playfully inane how much can you bench banter between dirk and reed constitutes one the film finest exchanges and while anderson creates rich collection fascinating characters problematic that some the the threads given the film characters are simply stale material julianne moore child custody battle fairly cliched stuff better suited for less risque and uninspired movie version her character story and far less interesting than the thread dealing with her woefully hackneyed filmmaking ambitions still even doesn always know what with his characters anderson most definitely captures their essences and his resolutely nonjudgemental affection for them infectious misguided even aimless hopelessly naive self destructive insufferable loved them just the same any case hard pick nits with screenplay which contains one the most audacious and inspired and ultimately best executed scenes the year scene where dirk diggler

that the millionaire crazed eccentric the part where stops the deal listen the crescendo night ranger sister christian his stereo system sheer brilliance flanked armed bodyguard this scene already wasn tense enough with these elements anderson introduces chinese boy that wanders through the scene who for discernable reason tossing firecrackers around the room pushing the scene new surreal level delightful giddiness there are some other interesting touches boogie nights anderson recycles the use long methodical chimes the soundtrack from hard eight here accompanies the violent intercut sequences which depict the prostration various characters frightening effect similarly painful scene where crew member scotty philip seymour hoffman breaks down tears the driver seat sobbing stupid after being rebuffed dirk after awkward but heartfelt advance strikingly played out exactly later scene with dirk the driver seat after particularly tumultuous and traumatic evening boogie nights exceedingly well cast and each the actors rise the occasion the ensemble cast uniformly good while most the acting accolades will doubt wahlberg fulfilling upon the sparks promise demonstrated some his earlier films and reynolds terrific the father figure and stable anchor the film ringing true every respect handful other performances which might otherwise overlooked deem mention reilly demonstrates here did for brief glimpses ulu grosbard georgia genuine aptitude for comedy many his scenes boogie nights are among the very funniest the film not sure how much his performance reed was scripted and how much was done the spot but plays the quintessential second banana character tee reilly the best part the big disco dance production number and wickedly funny watch his reed join with dirk after the fact threatening the new stud the block during macho altercation worth the price admission alone the glimpse him getting down the recording studio while the dirk character laying down numbingly bad and dead period sure sounds like bad early 1980s demo track you got the touch vain attempt musical career reilly plays his vacant character with utter conviction which convincing and effective graham with her long dirty blonde hair innocent demeanour and huge hazel eyes looks like disney animated heroine come life this case disney animated heroine who came life made wrong turn and ended the new line lot film focused the late 70s early 80s adult film industry consequently bit incongruous see this cheery sweet faced starlet whizzing about the set her roller skates but scene where she lounging limousine prowling the streets garish red lipstick messily smeared giving the camera hilariously pouty come hither look all one can gulp her role the film sadly needs more fleshing out err figurative sense she essentially glorified extra but she does score impressively her key scene which unnerving its sheer primal ferocity only anderson had filmed the scene that could actually see the expression rage and anguish her face though and cautionary tale for the strict and prudish teen graham parents forbade her take part the twisted cult classic heathers since then her most notable roles have been junkie gus van sant drugstore cowboy and now porn starlet draw your own conclusions perhaps the most quietly touching performance boogie nights that cheadle who lends dignity his role character search his identity and whose quest comically manifested series changes his sense fashion his relationship with his cheerfully supportive new wife jessie vincent interesting melora walters wholly compelling has genuine sweetness and although his general longing for acceptance from others perceptible more than the bank scene where his loan application open stereo store rejected due his

variation the same character maurice rodriguez hapless but good natured nightclub owner who hanger jack group ingratiating himself into the clique and constantly hounding jack with little disguise made his desperation for part one his erotic pictures jack eventual acquiescence maurice request leads one boogie nights biggest comic payoffs boogie nights stunning achievement due the virtuoso

1 |text jackie brown entered theaters with little fanfare and lot expectation even though advance publicity this one was fairly limited the audiences waited for the showings with heightened anticipation this after all the first movie quentin tarantino has directed since the highly touted pulp fiction say has been inactive between would tell falsehood since has been involved such projects destiny turns the radio desperado four rooms and from dusk til dawn was also called the last minute help punch the screenplay for crimson tide willing wager the debate over which silver surfer the only true silver surfer was penned him tarantino contributed and off screen these films but never took the director helm nearly four years since gaining notoriety the hollywood scene and making john travolta star once more tarantino returns with film can call his own the film opens with homage the graduate with jackie brown pam grier one those airport people movers the credits are displayed front her jackie flight attendant for air cabo which flies back and fourth between los angeles and cabo san lucas this makes jackie convenient cash courier for gun dealer ordell robbi samuel jackson who currently keeping his money stashed mexico however while bringing fifty thousand dollars back into the for ordell jackie apprehended fbi agent mark dargus michael bowen and atf agent ray nicolet michael keaton who catch her not only with the money but with bonus couple ounces illicit drugs jackie didn know they were the package with the cash but that consequence the authorities who threaten jackie with couple years hard time convicted course dargus and nicolet are just using the sentence get jackie turn over the big fish ordell ordell uses honest bail bondsman max cherry robert forster get jackie out jail but while max immediately attracted her jackie more concerned about her immediate safety since ordell killed the last one his operatives who got picked the police sure enough ordell shows jackie apartment that evening and tries silence jackie for good but she borrows max pistol and manages turn the tables ordell instead closing the irony circle and relocating bullet from the pistol chamber ordell head jackie proposes deal since ordell wants get his money out mexico jackie will get back her old tricks and courier for him once more but this time for more substantial fee fifteen percent ordell half million dollars with gun his face how can ordell not agree itself this premise might have been interesting enough carry the film however are also introduced number double crosses which make pay attention and think jackie claims bringing the money for ordell but she also making deal with the feds well with max the film throws off every once while leading believe the deal thought was authentic actually sham but way done the extent that feel jerked around instead actually nice departure from the predictability which prevalent many today movies least this film has little imagination most the performances jackie brown are above par pam grier whom had never taken notice before plays jackie with mix confidence and vulnerability which makes her character believable samuel jackson has kind mesmerizing quality about him handles himself situations where you know total control robert forster thoroughly likable because comes across such honest guy trying his best never mind that belongs profession where sneaking into guy apartment zap him with stun gun simply matter course just down earth the nature his job really doesn occur even when shown him bringing handcuffed woman prison when see the tools his trade supporting roles are robert niro louis gara recently paroled friend ordell and bridget fonda melanie one the girls ordell keeps around town unfortunately niro basically wasted his lines are few and far between and then they are mostly clipped sentences this film not really niro but stereotypical niro uttering things like little bit and pretty much fonda the other hand plays the slightly spaced out melanie with satisfactory relish and cuteness such that even when she annoying louis are taking her side characteristic any film which tarantino has had hand the dialog quick and snappy grabs our attention and actually interesting and many respects this makes jackie brown film which needs few visuals the lines are form art and amongst themselves don count tarantino out when comes using the camera however there scene where max unwittingly watching dry run money exchange and not really sure what happening but composing the scene just his realization what going felt simultaneously the audience look the screen and think gee that clever and then think the same thing about how the film induced into that wonderful feeling catching although tarantino isn afraid drag out shot for dramatic effect unfortunately works varying degrees this film there are shots where character simply driving and watch this person and somehow get idea what going his her head this tribute both direction and acting however there least one other scene where follow jackie through mall and she looking for something desperately looking for something get the idea the frantic nature her search but follow her for long that end not really caring about what she looking for but instead hoping she just stop overall viewing jackie brown time spent well some flap has already been made about the language used the film but really not much worse than many the other movies out there today fact one might even able say that the way which these offensive words are employed almost cause them parody themselves and therefore transcend their own offensiveness see the film and see what mean
1 |text the most common and many cases the only complaint against francis ford coppola 1972 masterpiece the godfather glamorising mafia which presented institution guided ancient tradition and virtues like honour loyalty and solidarity more suitable for some gentler kinder ages martin scorsese another italoamerican moviemaker confronted that perspective with his own more down earth vision mafia 1973 mean streets movie that dealt with lower echelons organised crime unfortunately for scorsese his film was unspectacular and too artsy compete with coppola influence mafia portrayals the movies seventeen years later scorsese returned mean streets new york with another film that dealt with darker side american organised crime this film was goodfellas epic black comedy which today considered one the best and most influential films 1990s goodfellas owes some its initial success and popularity the fact that was based the true story told best seller book wiseguy nicholas pileggi who would write the screenplay for the film the book well the film chronicled thirty years the life henry hill played ray liotta irish italian criminal from new york the age gets recruited the criminal organisation paulie cicero played paul sorvino local mob boss and gradually climbs the ladder starting with small errands after couple years together with his best childhood friend tommy vito played joe pesci joins the crew expert thieves led jimmy conway played robert niro three them spend years best friends and associates gathering enormous wealth from their criminal enterprises that would culminate with one the most spectacular robberies american history wealth influence and privileges men connected with mafia are enough for henry hill seduce his future wife karen played lorraine bracco who would afterwards remain loyal her husband despite infidelities domestic abuse arrests and would even accomplice his own private drug dealing business but the perfect world wiseguys gradually begins fall apart tommy unpredictable outbursts homicidal violence jimmy reluctance share his part the loot with partners and finally henry own drug habit would lead his downfall and make him question his loyalty the friends goodfellas excellent example film that represents work film genius his full glory scorsese managed create vision which effective and complete despite being full contradictions that would ripped the film apart the hands less talented filmmaker world depicted this film both ordinary and fascinating scorsese spares effort show all the violence hypocrisy and inherent paranoia organised crime yet manages make both seductive and funny after being exposed two and half hours the film and three decades criminal history based some notorious real life events the audience understands why the characters chose such dangerous life paths trading the superficial and short lasting glamour and prosperity criminal the dullness and poverty honest citizens scorsese also manages break viewer moralistic inhibitions showing truly revolting material scenes that depict personal tragedies broken homes human depravity violence bloodshed and murder all their uncompromising reality but manner that would make amusing and funny the audience with the use ironic soundtrack manipulative shots character dialogue narrator commentary goodfellas represents the new standards black humour that would became very popular few years later during tarantino era even don pay attention skills with which potentially disturbing material becomes eye pleasing and entertaining should admit that scorsese displays his talents truly original and creative filmmaker first might notice unusual structure the plot relatively minor subplot used movie ironic prologue then instead single narrator scorsese switches the second character narrator the middle the film only switch back the original shortly afterwards this multiple points views both terms narration and various subjective shots only lengthens the ironic distance towards characters and their situation same ironic distance comes with extremely effective choice soundtrack nostalgia for good old times illustrated with easy listening 1950s pop songs while depression paranoia and bad times find their expression more neurotic rock songs late 1960s and 1970s but the soundtrack most effective when used ironic comment almost pastoral easy listening tunes make strong and very ironic contrast the scenes violence and bloodshed however thing most associated with this film couple continuos shots that feature characters moving through large rooms and interacting with dozens not hundreds people such scenes although they require very great skill and patience during their shootings became very popular among other directors 1990s fragmentary character the screenplay which doesn have straight plot and instead bases film series loosely connected vignettes gives another interesting opportunity for scorsese uses this structure film experiment and most successful such experiments hilarious day life segment near the end the film another essential element goodfellas large but superb collection great acting talents the most respectable among them robert niro but his character who happen most quiet and business like member criminal trio gets overshadowed two his friends and colleagues joe pesci deserved his oscar for supporting role homicidal psychopath tommy and his lines including libs probably represent the most memorable element the film ray liotta although equally talented perhaps doesn look the best choice for narrator and nominal hero the film liotta henry hill looks somewhat too hollywoodised and glamorous among this bunch low level street thugs liotta the other hand improves general impression very realistic and menacing portrayal drug addiction lorraine bracco the other hand very effective and believable karen hill wife who gradually descends into same moral cesspool her husband paul sorvino also very effective patriarch mafioso and among the supporting cast most memorable chuck low pestering small time gangster who unknowingly digs his own grave combination clever sociological study black humour and innovative filmmaking goodfellas became something only the truly great films could work art and excellent popular entertainment the same time because this achievement and also because the great influence future filmmakers this cinematic gem deserves its rightful place among the best films 1990s

1 |text dangerous beauty really nothing more than grandiose soap opera set venice circa 1583 beautifully filmed wonderfully acted and certainly nothing short entertaining but lacks any true fundamental seriousness dealing with themes forbidden love religious intolerance subordination women sexual freedom and the roles pleasure and sin high cultured society still feels like brightly lit fluff the director marshall herskovitz doesn want follow the dark and dangerous trail this story could lead down opts for more genial livelier and relatively shallow interpretation the film takes place during the renaissance time when venice was the pleasure capital europe this time venice was its own republic and thrived being the central juncture east west commerce the film told almost entirely through the viewpoint the aristocracy and the bourgeoisie venice rarely get see how the rest the society lived however there abundance detail concerning the lives and livelihoods the upper classes their hedonistic lifestyles and constant merriment the story centers veronica franco catherine mccormack lower class woman who falls love with marco venier rufus sewell the son wealthy aristocratic parents jeroen krabb and joanna cassidy unfortunately the culture that time period did not view marriage act love rather was more like business transaction where rich families married their sons and daughters each other order secure power wealth and ensure that outsiders couldn get veronica despite her charm and good looks certainly outsider after short love affair marco breaks her heart with the news that cannot marry her however because she beautiful and intelligent veronica has chance enter marco world albeit not his wife she decides become courtesan class women who were well educated they were ravishing and sold their sexuality wealthy men for the privilege wining and dining with the elite courtesan was not mere prostitute they were afforded special place society and they were greatly revered respected and often envied one point character mentions that some rulers obtain more political advice from their courtesans than from their lieutenants veronica goes through the transformation with the help her mother paola jacqueline bisset who was once famed courtesan herself once she enters the lifestyle veronica finds that suits her quite well she allowed read all the books she wants she given the opportunity publish her poetry and she has the richest and most powerful men the republic throwing themselves her feet including the awestruck marco their relationship develops into playful bantering with veronica utilizing her newfound power constantly rejecting marco advances many ways their relationship sad because marco married women unable love and veronica consumed multiple relationships with men she unwilling love love the love not the man her mother told her dangerous beauty which was based factual book margaret rosenthal flows along smoothly and serenely the grand canal running through the heart venice has multiple plot lines including veronica adversarial relationship with court poet oliver platt her role obtaining france military assistance venice battle against the turks and even the dreaded shadow the plague and the encroachment the spanish inquisition yet never confusing overbearing much the film success due the glowing performance catherine mccormack the lead role known chiefly for the small part she played the lover whose murder raised mel gibson ire braveheart 1995 mccormack shows the true gifts and inarguable talent leading lady she has the kind exquisite classical beauty that would treasured courtesan her character intelligent witty and both sensual and vulnerable all which mccormack easily transmits with single flash her eyes the rest the roles are also filled well including rufus sewell whose performance here and earlier this month dark city have assured him solid place hollywood has the same kind unusual good looks and charm ray liotta and seems perfectly home period dramas oliver platt plays variation the comic relief role that has come inhabit like second skin although the film deals his character cheap blow the end having him improbably join the inquisition and turn into the bad guy platt good actor but just too hard hate jacqueline bisset proves that she every bit stirring she ever was and even fred ward turns small but moving performance marco uncle dangerous beauty marshall herskovitz sophomore directorial effort after the overlooked 1993 film jack the bear partnered with edward zwick herskovitz has spent most his time producer television thirtysomething called life and the movies legends the fall his directing style can best described transparent never gets the way the story yet has discernible flourish particular distinctions could have approached the film any number ways including overdosing the sexual aspect which wisely avoids dangerous beauty contains just enough bare flesh and ribald sex make appropriately erotic but not much that seems exploitative herskovitz also aided strong supporting crew including the luscious photography bojan bazelli whose previous efforts include the highly stylized thriller kalifornia 1993 and abel ferrara dark sci film body snatchers 1994 bazelli captures the film strong bold colors and brings sixteenth century venice life wide panoramic shots that are often enhanced with digital imagery however the real details are found the production design norman garwood brazil the princess bride and the costumes gabriella pescucci the age innocence the only problem with dangerous beauty that doesn stick with you good story well told with interesting characters but easy shrug off once you left the theater the only sequence that has the chance truly indelible veronica being pulled front the hypocrisy the inquisition and threatened with the death penalty for her transgressions but never quite comes off because simply too melodramatic and conventional herskovitz tries with all his might make nailbiter but somehow its outcome foregone conclusion and like the rest the film carries real weight despite the potential severity the subject matter

shark attached his leg had never thought that entry the modern incarnation the batman feature film would approach this level campiness but many instances batman and robin nears and some point even exceeds this standard this disasterously bad film easily the worst the series date and fairly epitomizes cinematic definition the word excessive loud garish and obnoxious with pointless gratuitous action sequences and set pieces which clutter the screen with elaborate production design the point overkill batman and robin features the caped crusaders george clooney debuting batman with chris donnell returing robin squaring off against another bevy chemically induced villains the nefarious ice cold freeze arnold schwarzenegger armed with weapon which freezes everything its sights and the

along and fails generate any genuine excitement makes goldsman screenplay batman forever which thought was dreadful look positively inspired comparison still astonished that cheesy plot device which seen used joke episode gilligan island somehow make its way into multimillion dollar blockbuster production joel schumacher direction batman and robin horrific with terrible balance flashiness over substance there clear conceit towards neon this film even moreso than with his previous batman forever with the revamped batcave helpfully sporting gigantic glowing emblems for the dynamic duo just case suppose they ever happen forget that the batcave the headquarters batman and robin and with neon prominently figuring utterly pointless fight sequence with bane and street gang over ivy chosen new abode another action sequence which fails serve any useful point other than chew five minutes screentime involves incredibly uninvolving late night motorcycle race with barbara and some gotham goons schumacher focus for batman and robin appears make the film visually striking possible the detriment the story there are drastic shifts the tone the film between all out camp and heartfelt drama with the latter completely unconvincing and ineffective perhaps not the most promising signs when the group was with burst out laughing within twenty seconds the film opening even before single line dialogue had been uttered batman and robin supposed campy think hard imagine that the filmmakers could have intended many parts the film taken all seriously one favourites was when bane helpfully grunted bomb each time laid down explosive device the gotham observatory supposed overly campy turned out somehow doubt the subplot involving afred delivered solemnly and with such graveness that the impression made that the film isn attempting the utter farce which arnold schwarzenegger top billed the film the villainous freeze and bland and uninteresting perhaps the worst thing that villain can schwarzenegger attempts menacing are laughable and his attempts conveying pathos are laughable frankly everything does onscreen laughable the end the film was stifling chuckle every time simply appeared onscreen the bulk his performance consists uttering near unintelligble puns and one liners featuring every possible permutation cool the least inventive way george clooney has been given very little batman and robin being overshadowed the villains and consequently looks rather uncomfortable the film his batman hardly imposing figure chris donnell unimpressive one note performance while alicia silverstone lackadasically fails make any impression all the film one saving grace undoubtably uma thurman entertaining performance sexy villainess poison ivy her work batman and robin certainly over the top but controlled fashion which works splendidly within the tone the film thurman comic timing impeccable and reminds that takes skilled performers make campiness work successfully already starting positively reassess jim carrey performance batman forever her amusing poison ivy the most entertaining character the film and when she offscreen the film greatly suffers figure that one has die being kissed death uma thurman isn half bad way while batman and robin was hardly ride pulse pounding excitement must admit that was not bored watching although did glance watch repeatedly through the screening attention was kept through anticipation the utterance yet another terrible pun one liner and awaiting yet another scene fall flat been long time since laughed much movie course

-1 |text the great actor james woods once said and paraphrasing sex isn messy then you not doing right truly profound statement and one that could made for the entire mad slasher genre just replace sex with your mad slasher film for those uninformed souls the mad slasher genre sub genre melding horror and exploitation elements put the service plot that follows identical outline usually masked but always crazed killer stalks and kills attractive teens halloween urban legend mad slasher flick but one that sanitary bloodless and nudity free that with its irony laden dialogue and beautiful though not overly talented cast more closely resembles overlong television special for film makers gore one the two weapons they have their disposal stale fright free horror movie stephen king once said again paraphrasing you can scare your audience gross out you can that make laugh alas urban legend succeeds only the latter though not intention actually find the fact that this film became minor success million domestic box office gross more frightening than anything seems that audiences tastes have been whittled down such degree that any movie even claiming scary given the benefit the doubt the promotion for urban legend sure promised thrills but how can anyone with three digit argue that provides them unfortunately these kinds flicks will continue produced because people longer have expectations one idiotic super hyped blockbuster flick after another has desensitized audiences the point where films don need anything more than promise good time without the added pressure delivering anyone disagrees would love for them explain the box office successes shit like batman and robin wild wild west and godzilla but forget all that goes without saying that mad slasher films any other exploitation off shoot will made without ounce craft especially considering the sheer volume that are produced allow present you with the real fault the mad slasher film the lack enthusiastic exploitation these flicks aren harnessed with any lofty aspirations why not break free and give your audience bloody good time sadly out the literally hundreds made would estimate that maybe three are all worth while and urban legend would certainly not included amongst those three despite its considerable production value and the absence any boom mics slipping into frame just awful any budget entry the slasher sweepstakes far the possibility some good natured exploitation urban legend setting alone offers myriad promising possibilities takes place college campus which always appropriate playground for the crazed killer you see the campus community made almost entirely young people all the midst strange hormonal surges percolating beneath the surface all those young people are growing together going through all kinds inexplicable emotional highs and lows naturally some weirdness expected all the better for that elusive crazed killer coupled with the copious amounts scantily clad coeds running around and the introduction little exploitation into the proceedings should relatively easy task but alas urban legend not only idiotic and clich full way too clean slasher flick for the whole family with nudity little gore and much stupidity this the kind movie where the killer drags dead victims from the scene the crime for reason other than dunno exercise the kind movie where the villain calmly purses running like the wind prey yet still manages catch that prey through some really awful editing techniques the kind movie where characters run into each other just loud clash reverberates the soundtrack really wish filmmakers would just retire that whole loud noise jump scare thing yes the audience jumps momentarily frightened but wouldn anyone loud sonic boom suddenly infiltrated quiet room lost all hope for the possibility any genuine scares urban legend about ten minutes when caught glimpse the killer apparently filmmakers are running out creative ways disguise their mad slashers scream was ghost mask scary enough know what you did last summer was fisher man rain slicker the middle summer less and urban legend the disguise sinks the level mel brooks parody the villain wears oversized parka with fury hood ooh scary intended conceal his her identity for urban legend humbly suggest donald duck costume though must admit urban legend does have winning premise for what could have been somewhat entertaining exploitation film the film killer slices and dices comely college students the tune famous urban legends you know like the babysitter gets threatening phone calls only find that they coming from inside the house won spoil the surprise what urban legends are used after all the film does offer fine cable viewing you happen intoxicated enough sad say doesn include favorite urban legend fairly graphic antidote concerning richard gere and very unhappy gerbil now that would scary before leave you would like bring your attention the third most irritating thing about the film the first being the lack craft the second the lack exploitation its characters all whom are just about the most annoying group people ever spent evening with only jared leto looking like carbon copy rob lowe from back the day and alicia witt the resilient heroine avoid vexatiousness the most annoying the bunch tie between noxima girl rebecca gayheart and sitcom star michael rosenbaum supremely irritating lout irritating actually cheered his painful death and not cruel person ironically those aggravating sacks human waste provide the only entertainment the film viewed vicarious fantasy urban legend can mildly entertaining after all this movie that features the kind faux hipsters can stand getting slaughtered which least better than watching entire

1 |text not really sure what think about crash the surface cold boring unerotic porn with name starts name director and some cool camerawork mean left completely bored unsatisfied and generally kinda weirded out but then again not every film supposed leave you entertained crash structured play like porn flick but with significantly more plot and dialogue while see several extremely taboo scenes weirdo sex also have skimpy little plot going mostly towards the beginning and maybe just hair characterization not mention the acting generally pretty good and don really see lot the actors completely exposed but what makes supremely different from porn the fact that this not erotic experience this film does not posess the erotic hypnotism henry and june the just plain horniness say deep throat not that seen one was made completely hot this film would probably mean they were also into the whole auto eroticism thing the film leaves you cold erotically and maybe many other ways but what does present group people who live the edge the film opens woman catherine deborah kara ungar the game pressing her bare breast against car public air hangar suddenly man enters the frame and begins take her from behind the film doesnt show all this though even the next scene has film director james james spader having sex with camera woman alice poon office the highly populated set his movie the next scene has the two coming together revealing that they husband and wife and them sharing one another escapades while the two are arguably freaky people least know they love live the edge soon afterwards james driving down the road night reclessly course reading something when drifts into the other lane and then hits another car face james not killed but the passenger the other car flies into his seat obviously dying leaving the driver helen remington holly hunter porn also alive the two through therapy together and when getting out they run into eachother again when james gives her ride home they almost get into another accident and immeadiately afterwards they unbusy parking lot and have little quickie they were aroused the accident you wouldn think there would many people who shared this same kind fetish but they run into freaky guy named vaughan elias kosteas and his crutch carrying girlfriend gabrielle rosanna arquette who are also into vaughan into living the edge they are but takes another level loves recreate famous car crashes one scene and friend colin seagrave peter macneill recreate james dean car crash without any padding safety belts and suffer some concussions but nevertheless get rush and the attention the police soon these five are all having sex with one another straight gay lesbian sex while this admittingly all bit comical the film almost like black comedy the film does pretty awesome portrayal people who main fetish living the edge sure somewhere there are people who get aroused car accidents but personally don see connection between car crashes and sex the main connection cronenberg shows that both give definite rush his car crash scenes are quick and exciting mini masterpieces first not sure they take place but everytime looks like may occur gasp then when happens hold our breath the same thing happens with sex although not the same fashion these people are merely taking another level the only problem with the film that tad redundant normal porn lasts from hour hour and half this goes for about 100 minutes and just seems little too long the sex and car crashes are far between one another and the time between them are tad the boring side there characterization although could definitely argued that hey porn and not here sympathize but still they coulda cut down bit but the film saved with its presentation well some other elements the atmosphere very dark and forboding creating kind cool weird feeling and there are several scenes are just amazing one scene has catherine and james having sex while she softly asks him questions about being with man which sounds almost erotic the way she says sequence involving one character death filled with all the edgy disjointment that the film needs and the final shot shot perfectly creating image car crash and couple having sex front despite the fact that she wounded the acting also pretty good especially for what almost porn ousting linda lovelace best actress porn while james spader pretty boring usually pretty intense deborah kara ungar amazing she speaks all her words almost zombie like hushes and when she having sex she has blank look her face not showing the viewer whether she enjoying not one scene she actually looks dead while someone having sex with her holly hunter who gets extra credit just for appearing something like this pretty good and rosanna arquette who adds kinda cool kinkiness her role but the film stolen elias kosteas who plays his character intensely that almost upstages everyone often speaks out breath showing definite affinity for his way life has great deal energy several scenes especially one scene where taking photographs picture and later scene where getting freaky tatoo and spader share sexual chemistry several scenes foreshadowing later scene kosteas little known actor his biggest role was casey jones teenage mutant ninja turtles but here shows deniro like presence hinting that capable bigger roles while hardly enjoyed crash still pretty intriguing portrayal group people who the exist are some the strangest and most bizarre people the world these people are able share rush between two completely different entities and the film which doesn exactly pain them negative light sucessful bringing them light even leaves the viewer unnerved and generally freaked out despite the hardcore nature the film and the subsequent rating there also rated version but wouldn even near that thing anyone looking for quick turn should just rent regular porno

1 |text _in brief this film needs introduction you haven heard then you must have been space sabbatical and you haven seen well suspect you small minority first thing first all hyped well yes and good film and there lot like about but not without its problems when saw the first trailer for titanic was when went see bean last summer think intial reaction was ain that downright sick make disaster movie out such dreadful real life tragedy mean what happened hollywood script writers have they run entirely out new ideas gads whatever next asked myself how about action film based hiroshima starring jean claude van damme was not entirely filled with anticipation but then wasn alone that respect when came out the cinema rave reviews well mostly and anyone who been see seemed disturbingly obsessed that started take notice didn see the film until several months after its release which time sister had seen about four times went with slightly more open mind but still didn think enjoy much did yes and mainly yes happy say the first hour was beautifully done not much because the scripting talk about that later but because the created ship and sets were stunning look was cameron directing and the performances the principal cast were strong that the human aspect the story the romance between rose kate winslet and jack leonardo dicaprio was enchanting the film told via flashback with gloria stuart playing the elderly rose the modern day you knew that course well often effective device use storytelling though sometimes can fall flat does work here script form doesn add all that much the story what does add lot the story gloria stuart whose stunning performance the strongest most moving the film her presence brings much deeper level passion and depth the story and though her appearances are relatively brief the film would have suffered without her also impressive are dicaprio and winslet who wholly succeed rising above the often poor dialogue and the bond they form both heartfelt and moving old story you know forbidden love ala romeo and juliet but works and jack rescuing rose both literal and figurative senses and teaching her live life for what counts was pointed and touching fact enjoyed the first half the film lot largely because winslet and dicaprio bring such and charm energy the romance engaging touching and very enjoyable there more than tinge poignancy well simply because you know not going happy ending which leads the second half the film all knew was coming sure director cameron was looking forward with eager anticipation because stated interviews the real thrust the story for him was the sinking and the jack rose romance was merely manipulative plot device get you emotionally into the film think that understates the importance the romance found far more enjoyable than hour watching people die the iceberg arrives and the captain announces that titanic will have sunk about hour and hour goodness don miss second that hour gratuitous well perhaps not today standards sure there been far worse produced under the banner entertainment other films but certainly wasn prepared for how shocking and graphic the last hour would not that expect the word understatement part cameron vocabulary who brought such umm vivid films terminator and aliens overdone thought understatement can sometimes work wonders conveying tragedy one expected happy ending but didn quite expect the horrendously shocking and powerful scenes were bombarded throughout the film second half still whether was overdone and heavy handed not was the shock factor cameron was after worked because was shocked and moved fact spent most the last hour tears you really couldn help but get emotionally involved whether was wishing someone would knock that dreadfully psychotic fiance rose overboard desperately hoping that rose would rescue jack that jack would rescue rose that they would both survive perhaps the most harrowing scene was when the ship has sunk and those that sunk along with the ship freeze death the water surface the bit where rose lets jack hand while promising she never let her heart was particularly heart wrenching and the sight rescue boats sailing amid the ocean corpses was pretty powerful image put fine point loved the ending however which was both moving and slightly uplifting following the horror the past hour and half established that the film powerful and moving the last hour was rather excessive haven mentioned the script plot wise though the jack rose relationship was beautifully developed but feeling that the actors credit anything for the dialogue well titanic set 1912 period drama but saw very little indication period far the dialogue concerned did they really use phrases like goddamn back the turn the century doubt would someone talk like this love the guy what doubt such dialogue saw the iceberg and see your eyes now not just bit clumsy yes little more attention dialogue would not have gone astray and cameron himself blame wrote the script stick with directing dude but its more than redeemed the acting with dicaprio and winslet fine form ably supported strong cast star the show was gloria stuart though why didn she win that oscar after all they were throwing oscars titanic left right and centre but gloria was perhaps the most deserving nominee directing wise cameron does spectacular job like said his vision was bit excessive but least directed well haven even mentioned james horner beautiful score utterly heavenly though when your dad and sister play the soundtrack lot you start get bit bored with finished rant which lasted lot longer than thought would just leaves couple questions was worth all those oscars hell don talk about oscars bloomin farce was deserving number departments though last

-1 |text synopsis sullen julie james still haunted nightmares the killer ben willis from know what you did last summer perks when her new best friend karla wilson wins trip for four the bahamas arriving the start the hurricane season julie and karla run around very tight clothing and realize they walked into trap set the rainslickered slasher with huge hook for hand comments may showing some pop culture illiteracy here but have never seen episode the fox series party five only vaguely aware the show premise and knowledge comes from brief commercials half paid attention while watching the tube party five know however seems the starting ground for actresses the teen horror genre neve campbell scream queen the 90s and star scream scream and the craft regular the show too jennifer love hewitt and behold following the footsteps campbell hewitt now has horror franchise her own the know what you did last summer line though the original film released last year was watchable enough this insipid sequel had looking the theater glowing red exit sign longingly throughout jennifer love hewitt very good looking young leading lady however unlike neve campbell hewitt struggles with acting she just isn convincing this film and she wasn the original either this puts many young males including myself paradoxical quandary she very attractive but the annoying spoiled valley girl type character she tries play here annoying the extreme and ruins many the scenes which emphasize exploitatively her figure add the mix the equally pleasant yet irritating brandy another rising teen star and you get one frustrated male audience spent much time hewitt and brandy for reason still know what you did last summer though cashing the success the original ultimately serves vehicle for these two young actresses nothing else here original interesting this movie fact makes other recent horror films like urban legend and john carpenter vampires seem like stunning works high art still know relies heavily tired slasher film cliches isolated location storm parentless teenagers false alarm nightmares lots blue lighted darkness scenes garbed slasher who walks around the background without the characters seeing him knives and other sharp instruments lying around everywhere etc you get the picture the entire audience knows all the secondary characters introduced the film are going receive the business end the killer hook they may well have huge targets painted them like scream and its numerous knockoffs these secondary characters are supposed serve comic relief unfortunately still know characters aren all that funny particular one character chain weed smoking guy obnoxiously annoying and certainly doesn die soon enough the death scenes the way are relatively violent for theatrically released horror film several them are uncomfortable watch and they reminded the sickening gore scenes hellraiser bloodline truly sadistic movie this too did not help the supposed humor still know was shooting for and what the deal with the slasher himself know that the slasher film not particularly intelligent genre but ben willis has got down one the most silly slashers mainstream horror come the guy looks like the gorton fisherman and his gruff voice makes him sound like disney pirate though his lightning lit appearances ellicited much needed laughter the theater his appearance borders the absurd the horror film and that really saying something all that left talk about here jennifer love hewitt and brandy both prance about tightfitting revealing outfits various states undress yet neither them ever actually nude scene hewitt however does post shower scene which her thin bathrobe quite titillating this scene alone made this one star turkey earn two stars under rating system otherwise hewitt and brandy both grate the nerves early the film for instance brandy wins the trip the bahamas she and hewitt jump around and scream and screech for what seems like forever needed extra strength tylenol after that part and the film conclusion talk about repetitive people who saw know what you did last summer will predict still know ending least minutes before happens boring saw this movie with brother the local downtown movie theater admission only one dollar wednesdays and often see bad movies these days just ridicule them usually fun thing along with the rest the audience who don seem mind participating mass mystery science theater 3000 type viewing still know what you did last summer however produced several lengthy uncomfortable silences from the audience underscoring how bad really weren for the main actresses revealing wardrobes have had very very hard time sitting through this lame sequel can imagine trying watch video horror films seem times better theater because they rely heavily audience participation and wouldn recommend people unless they horror film fanatics huge fans hewitt and brandy read website somewhere that another sequel already the works what depressing thought hewitt apparently needs spend more time figuring out how act rated this film contains lots violence several gory scenes and couple nubile horny teenagers though the sex act itself always thwarted say this unsuitable for kids but teens wouldn have problem sitting through especially since they obviously compose the film target audience

1 |text there are times when the success particular film depends entirely one actor effort often single performance can turn what might have been rather mediocre movie into something worthwhile when one these comes along usually try think about how many other people put work into the movie that there way one person could possible carry the entire project his shoulders but sometimes there simply other explanation and such the case with the hurricane this biopic about falsely convicted boxer rubin hurricane carter would normally called norman jewison the hurricane per the tradition referring film belonging director but though does decent work jewison cannot claim ownership the hurricane because there one reason this film works all and his name denzel washington washington plays carter boxer who 1967 was convicted late night shooting bar jailed for years maintained that had never committed the crimes but remained jail after second trial and countless appeals the situation changed when group canadians moved washington and worked freeing carter through the efforts that group and carter lawyers was eventually freed when their case was heard federal court and the judge ruled that rubin carter had been unfairly convicted the film details carter childhood which had him and out jail because the efforts racist cop dan hedaya when finally got out prison for good carter became rising star middleweight pro boxer seemingly having his career track until the police framed him for multiple homicide despite the efforts political activists and celebrities remained imprisoned flash forward 1983 when lesra vicellous reon shannon young african american boy living with group canadian tutors reads the book carter wrote while prison the book entitled the sixteenth round opens young lesra eyes the injustice that was carter life and vows help free the incarcerated boxer lesra convinces his canadian friends deborah unger liev schreiber john hannah work with him towards his goal the hurricane leans denzel washington must carry virtually every scene sheer force will and does brilliantly probably accurate say that washington does not embody rubin carter because plays character far stronger and nobler than any real person could hope would perhaps more accurate say that washington embodies the character rubin carter fictional personality invented solely for the film the actor work masterful washington throws himself into every moment refusing keep the audience arm length feel everything feels the humiliation having return prison after fighting hard make something his life the pain having order his wife give the fight and the utter despair feels when coming the conclusion that all hope lost washington performance weight and emotional depth doesn merely play angry happy sad feels the deepest level his work masterful and for half this film realized that the scene was watching would not have been nearly affecting was had been the hands another actor norman jewison directs the film doing reasonably good job pacing and shot selection the hurricane moves quickly with scene drawn out much further than necessary and the narrative galloping along nicely jewison handles his multiple flashbacks well the audience always aware just what the time and place each scene and nothing terribly confusing his boxing scenes constructed with clear inspiration from raging bull get inside the action very well and they are believable real sports footage jewison puts together particularly nice scene utilizing pretty cool trick carter sent solitary confinement for days when refuses wear prison uniform and jewison assisted some wonderful acting from game washington shows how carter gradually starts lose his mind during the constant solitude and eventually get three rubin carters arguing with each other one cell jewison best achievement the hurricane succeeding showing how carter becomes embittered man during his hard knock life and how able break out that bitterness and learn trust people again sadly though the film chief failures lie with the screenplay with most the good but not great efforts round the pike this winter there much interest viewer the hurricane but seems that every time the film gets chance take the most clich route possible does take look the supporting characters for example who are drawn either entirely good entirely evil carter and lesra played nicely shannon who deserves credit are the only real people here everyone else stereotype the canadians are good the cops are bad the canadians spend most their time dolefully grinning each other their lovey dovey commune and commune despite the film failure make that clear while every racist cop especially dan hedaya melts out the shadows and glowers every black person that enters the room much the dialogue comes off rather hokey hate put prison love gonna bust out and the big courtroom climax during which everyone gets make impassioned speech could have been lifted from made for lifetime special too bad the cast game the director does his job and the subject matter interesting but the script takes the safer slightly more boring route far too often wanted real reason for the cop hold grudge against carter other than racist pig wanted more evidence that these canadians are real people with faults and virtues instead bunch saintly crusaders looking for justice short wanted see the film through less distorted lens criticism has been levied against the liberties the hurricane takes with the truth what really happened carter and much deserved for example the film gives boxing scene showing carter pummeling defending champ joey giardello only screwed the judges who ruled giardello the winner most accounts the fight however have carter losing fairly furthermore much carter criminal past conveniently left out the film and just why was convicted again his second trial never really explained course the hurricane works mainly fable digressions from the truth can excused least partially but even dismissing such issues don remove one fact the hurricane highly flawed film only one actor could have made schmaltzy predictable picture like this work well does and good thing the hurricane has that actor carter has been quoted saying denzel washington making look good but not the only one washington makes this film look good denzel washington the hurricane sounds pretty good

1 |text may seem weird begin film about glam rock with sequence that includes spaceship green ovular pin and the birth oscar wilde but one really strains they can see that perhaps maybe these connections are not half off wilde philosophy was that everyone should true their own human nature and the result his following this philosophy was that was imprisoned loosing his family and his career the glam rock movement the early 70s england had similar take and came similar demise the main difference was placing makeup their face and acting out their deepest fantasies and inquiries about life mostly dealing with androgony and sexuality they became less and less like themselves and more and more like everyone else and that why the movement seemed end soon began been said that todd haynes velvet goldmine the film that chronicles what was like part the movement not only from those who experienced but those who created steals lot from citizen kane and that true the film british journalist the 80s arthur stuart christian bale asked back and find out what happened 70s glam rock star brian slade fictitious rock star who faked his own death stage bringing the end not only his career but the entire glam rock movement structure wise this totally steals from kane not only from the set interviews three people and the story result their flashbacks but other things like the beginning death then newsreel and smaller details like the bitter friend wheelchair and the bitter wife washed lounge singer found bar after hours this kane and really doesn aspire doesn attempt the deep outlook something gone like kane did and doesn really uncover anything poignant about humanity instead uses the flashbacks form contrast between the magic that was the glam rock era and the boredom that was life after glam rock for those who were participants the 80s scenes are dry and deliriously melancholy equipped with performance bale that perhaps appropriately dull and unengaging but the 70s scenes are engaging though not mention addictively campy they radiate with gorgeous cinematography that nicely accentuates all the vibrant colors the era and feel that eerily lighthearted that when combined with the then footage they become not only symbol decadence but times when everything seemed simple instead creating the world the way was haynes paints their own world were narcotic fairy tale the glam rock movement was full much freedom and liberation that after you experienced everything else seems mundane there outside world speak secluding these people inside protective globe that will eventually crack haynes focuses his story the tale blade and the other fictitious rock hero curt wild and their relationship that created molded and then brought down the movement reducing everyone else who contributed merely that contributors blade played with reserve the pouty jonathan rhys meyers and wild played with anarchic wildness ewan mcgregor are little more than thinly disguised recreations david bowie and iggy pop respectively complete with the creation ziggy stardust persona named maxwell demon and the confirmation that the two rock stars may have very well not only have been one time partners music but also partners bed through discussions with slade manager cecil michael feast wife mandy toni collette reinventing herself american blonde dish who fakes british accent when with slade and finally partner wild journalist stuart begins remember his own experiences the era like his discovery his rebelliousness cum conformity including the moment when began questioning his own sexuality when opens his first slade record finds naked and green slade lying crimson blanket and finally running away from home part the london scene finally resulting leading boring job america haynes demonstrates that quite the visual auteur molding scenes that are like long heald breaths such seemingly long sequence juxtaposing slade wild concert them performing brian eno cover baby fire with scenes from decadent drug party and the film most wow inspiring sequence the first concert scene wild with his band the ratttz where mcgregor lets loose much anarchic steam that his wild iggy esuqe movements including stripping naked and screams that the film captures that perfect moment when one discovers major talent and another slade discovers his idle even the brief music videos spoofs bowie have rare visual flair that pure camp and which would cause ken russell drool the best sequence though may the beginning following the prelude sequence which acts the middle ground for both the actual being the movement and the post movement era stuart and his mates are going the infamous slade concert where fakes his own death where kills off his alter ego maxwell demon what appears real assasination which brought about the end the era one swift fake bullet with brian eno famous needle the camel eye playing the background the scene has detached exhileration the song doesn seem played quite the same way the other songs are has distance that hard put finger and seems represent that all this coming quick and sad ending and when one sees slade the dressing room before the show docked silver frock with wings and blue hair depressingly staring into the mirror comes off none too obvious prophecy the finale the beginning the film this movie not much about plot but more about the way presented making this one those films which classified being style over substance statement which prompts many critics line for attack however for the most part the engaging part this film not the story but rather the way which haynes creates this world using his sets costumes cinematography and especially the music play characters his film the music especially notable the soundtrack which wall wall consists old school glam rock tunes the likes brian eno rex and roxy music well covers slade band with vocals thom yorke and occasionally rhys meyers himself and even newer music shudder think that sounds uncannily bowie like the cast rather impressive but one really walks away with the film and performances are extremely good although eddie izzard slade manager who challenges slade first manager arm wrestling match see who gets control his career and michael feast the first and tragic manager come off greatly and collette and mcgregor have their moments rhys meyers and bale are noticably sub par neither putting lot effort into their respective roles some fault with the actual construction the film haynes rhys meyers brian slade remains merely metaphor for the glam rock era dying when turned into retro garbo resorting life salinger ism and found the mid 70s lying around sniffing coke off the ass party girl fact one this film really seen person rather than just symbol composite type who thrived during the era bale character especially tough sell bitter and depressed flashbacks his young adulthood not extremely personal character and his cliched experiences being hounded the record store guys for buying record put out poof never help communicate with him nevertheless rhys meyers and mcgregor have the excuses that their characters are not really characters but rather the results era that has left them and others bitter part which helps the film work since this major piece eye candy the prime the movie they least look the role fashionable leaders slade with his perpetually changing androgonys persona and wild with his topless and unpredictable image which clash and fuse into unstable union their story how slade was influenced wild that adapted into similar who cares attitude crossed with camp engaging without the personal background the story stuart though tougher sell because the everyman and when you can totally identify with the everyman your story slight trouble cultural rock piece velvet goldmine rather good but merely good never totally takes off although has moments where absolutely flies but then comes back down really nothing more than bunch really great moments surrounded material that could really much better the beginning captivating but slow the middle fantastic and the ending not only shallow but worse than that drags the final half hour not only does not bring the story any real conclusion could probably stop any point and did anyone really figure out what the mystery that arthur unearths almost seems like there was point the entire investigation other than unearth the past which commendable but not totally still does what the oliver stone pic the doors didn right becoming very insightful what happened using the visual style hit most the right notes contrast between what made the era great those who lived during and why after living through such era that everything else seems half assed suppose the message live life but after you lived what else the point when you forced live with regretful memories the really superb achievement this film that during its flashbacks successfully creates for the audience what must have felt like that era but with the added perk knowing the result all that goes down

1 |text taking few tips from the pulp fiction school filmmaking the new feature from the director the cult hit swingers the story centres around group people who include brit simon askew and checkout girls claire holmes and ronna polley and the misadventures that they get into split into three chapters everything from sex drugs violence covered film with much blacker edge comedy than swingers although touch evident nearly every frame entertaining enough forget about the similarities and just enjoy the rollercoaster ride liman who also photographed the film has deft touch with the camera and the film looks good the film also seems have benefited from budget with the night club scenes particular looking pretty good there twisted sense humour running throughout which ensures that even the darkest scenes get smirk the young cast are talented and help bring the story life holmes one the dawson creek cast show not particularly fond displays much talent here and despite her largely limited screen time manages make three dimensional character and never becomes caricature askew slightly successful being rather obnoxious doubt the filmmakers intended this make the audience cheer when what happens him but instead funny annoying just annoying drags down slightly one the funniest chapters but the talent around him that particular tale more than makes for the real standout sarah polley the drug dealing checkout girl her refreshing and deeply enjoyable performance makes the heavy going stories she involved much more entertaining also entertaining timothy olyphant the rather sinister drug dealer who gives nice evil performance the script written john august sharp and witty with good dialogue and some funny jokes starts off rather slow however but about twenty minutes the script has found footing and just keeps getting better the stories are largely satisfying although occasionally there too much attention one detail but not another also some the endings seem little forced and lucky still the cast have meaty script get into and obviously enjoy could tried little harder some parts however and these parts lag because this gen xer movie the obligatory rave soundtrack must accompany and one pretty decent unlike other gen xers movies never allows the music substitute for plot dialogue which plus very easy movie absorb into and the audience really starts feeling for these characters thankfully they never become two dimensional characters who are bent and twisted throughout the movie fit into the stories mechanics like the heroine things hate about you they are who they are and they stay that way great fun and worthy follow from the director swingers ignore the fact that steals from pulp fiction and very bad things and just sit back and enjoy the rollercoaster ride erm guess
1 |text the wake the smashing success rumble the bronx looking more and more likely that more jackie chan films will see american release rumor has that one these films will drunken master the version have copy from the laserdisc widescreen and bilingually subtitled are most hong kong films these days availability over here the united states very limited these films must either purchased via pirates sought out from asian distributors such tai seng the subtitling the copy have slightly hard read the letters are white and bit small although the american release will almost certainly dubbed this review the subtitled version please keep that mind you reading this review help you decide whether out and see fair must admit that never been very fond period piece martial arts movies the ones set some nebulous china the distant not distant past perhaps because most those seen were filmed inferior stock with either butchered dubbing all but illegible subtitling perhaps because their plots all tend very similar each other and many cases all but nonexistant fact many them get wrapped their subplots that they seem forget their main plot entirely until only few minutes before the end for that matter might because the jackie chan films with more modern settings armour god rumble the bronx etc tend have more spectacular stunts often involving large motor vehicles and large explosions whereas period pieces simply have the martial arts having said that must now turn right around and say that drunken master remarkable exception all most the above one the better martial arts films seen and quite enjoyed surprised well was drunken master about young man named wong fei hong played jackie chan who master the drunken boxing style kung where learned this style uncertain his father wong kei ying lung steadfast his opposition fei hong practicing rather than some more normal style kung apparently fei hong some sort figure from chinese folklore rather like paul bunyan for americans but heard very little about this and could quite well wrong leave analysis that the people who know better one friends points out that the character wong fei hong also featured the once upon time china movies but have not yet seen those the plot drunken master somewhat hazy are the plots many such films but you watching jackie chan film odds are you aren expecting something the order war and peace the story seems revolve around those evil foreigners who are spiriting away ancient chinese relics and hence china cultural heritage while overworking underpaying and beating chinese workers nearby steel mill however this plot merely serves framework for the other main story the film fei hong perpetual struggle win his girlfriend supplicate his father keep his pregnant mother played anita mui from fighting and keep from getting beaten evil foreigner thugs the macguffin that drives the plot precious antique jade imperial seal which being taken away the evil foreigners the beginning fei hong accidentally steals while trying recover identically wrapped box containing the medicinal ginseng his father was bringing back for customer the process clashes with another thief who himself trying for the seal but ends instead with the ginseng after fei hong narrowly avoids getting caught with the seal the evil foreigners lackies thanks some timely intervention general son cameo appearance andy lau who would later take the starring role drunken master iii comedic chaos ensues back the wong household when fei hong and his mother attempt come with replacement for the missing ginseng and goes and the plot thickens later such when fei hong girlfriend maneuvers him into kung match with rival when fei hong and the thief now revealed loyalist manchu officer trying recover the seal and stop the evil foreigners are attacked masse another grand kung movie tradition but think already spent more time the plot than really deserves let move the real draw jackie chan movies the action there plenty martial arts action found this movie course kung film that expected however this isn just another kung movie this one has jackie chan doing the fight and stunt choreography and jackie chan genius the primary martial arts style featured the film drunken boxing form kung which attempts draw the adversary off his guard making seem like the fellow using drunk further for the purposes this film least drunken boxers fight better when they actually _are_ intoxicated but there fine line between just drunk enough and drunk into stupor under normal circumstances the idea someone staggering around looking sloshed but managing fight effectively and even incredibly might seem rather stupid but jackie pulls off with flair the kung sequences are intricate their staging and execution that pointless try describe paper just say that the fights especially the big climactic fight the end themselves make the movie worth watching another thing drunken master has going for the stunt work even without motor vehicles well not counting train there are some remarkable stunts this film among other things jackie dives off balcony into table and crawls across hot coals not once but _least_ twice you count the outtake shown during the credits quicktime movies these stunts can found through the www movie database unlike american films these stunts are _not_ faked drunken master stars several veteran actors the hong kong movie scene including jackie lung better tomorrow and anita mui the heroic trio series rumble the bronx the performances are first rate especially when comes the comedy parts the film the scene where fei hong and his mother conspire literally behind fei hong father back cover for the missing ginseng root hilarious the scene where fei hong mother having just revealed that she pregnant threatening hurt herself order draw her husband anger away from fei hong jackie has developed his knack for physical comedy into sort mastery over the years and fine form all through drunken master far cinematography concerned certainly works for this film nothing spectacular but least dozen times better than all those old kung movies the 70s the picture crisp and clear one thing find particularly worthy mention that least the copy have the screen was wider than any film ever seen videotape before almost whole the screen was blocked out above and below watch this bigscreen movie theater you can will utter shame this film eventually pan and scanned for american video release drunken master shows the full potential period piece kung movies and good enough overcome even usual distaste for such movies the plot does meander bit but that expected this type film you like this kind movie you love this movie and not well give chance anyway nothing else the martial arts and stunt sequences are themselves worth the price admission rental

1 |text think the first thing this reviewer should mention wether not fan the files first let assure you that prior experience with the series required fully enjoy this movie the producers are not stupid making movie just for fans the series not profitable you have reach for larger audience therefore the movie quite user friendly altough non fans will only fail understand certain emotions behind the looks many characters exchange but fear not duchovny and another man later provide more than adequate background info what going you will never feel you just walked the third act some great opera any case the answer not fan the files only watch when nothing else and prefer millennium however since the fox network been kind air several key episodes for several weeks before the movie opening weekend took that opportunity test the movie taped all these episodes and watched them only after seing the movie glad report that learned nothing new everything you need know explained the viewer duchovny and others know going maybe bit too far make point but everybody should get the chance experience this movie warning major spoilers follow please not read fully enjoy this movie you must not able know what coming what exactly over that hill and what that weird hummm sound all about you have been warned the files what summer should exciting scary great special effects unlike other summer movies the effects not take over the movie and are only there when really necessary and good performances this coming from guy who thinks david duchovny the human equivalent wooden plank from start finish this movie does not let you when compare with last summer movies the best way describe would take the excitement and great score from face off and the deadly use sound from event horizon this flick scary not movie kind way where you always know where and when the critter will jump our heroes fact the first time the critter this movie makes apperance totally out the blue you might well bring ear plugs because this thing louuuudd the last time monster scared that much was when first saw aliens six year old kid you know when you are affraid put your feet the floor because the creature might under the chair when you keep trying cover your throat with your shirt yeah the files scary and guess what you never even have see the monster but your imagination works overtime and sure beats having watch flawed computer generated babyzilla looks like you could walk right through not even scarier than your grandma undies type monster not think that the files monster movie fact the creature there for maybe three minutes total the files definately mulder episode the series scully his side course but gillian anderson gets maybe half the screen time she has couple good scenes with duchovny but she gets kidnapped during the last half hour the movie she does not get much this mulder time the spotlight now you have heard the scene where mulder showers independence day you have not then will not spoil for you let just say that due recent events mulder should showering godzilla instead those you wondering mulder discovers that the truth indeed out there who cares did find the series would over anyway what are you complaining about the dialogue interesting and the director marvelous the camera almost always looking over the shoulder our heroes feel are right there with them when they open door climb hill the script spotless every thing that happens happens for purpose you are confused something not worry because will all become clear later but and cannot stress this enough pay attention unlike most summer movies the dialogue twice important the effects miss one vital piece information and like most people who talk during movies you will home and tell all your friends how this movie made sense also those people who need the bathroom during movies don the person who watched the movie with had twice and twice she missed important conversation there time take breather between scenes because again unlike most summer movies godzilla anybody the files does not need fill scenes between the suspense and the action with useless subplots every scene crucial and serves purpose who needs see the blond chiouaoua have big emotional scene between godzilla attacks far this summer have seen only one movie who ranks higher list movies recommend and that the truman show but only wins nose but the truman show not what would call summer movie the files what more you ask from summer movie other than the chance excited cool effects got some pulse pounding hell yes strangely enough think that fans the series will hate this movie while non fans will have good time does not provide answers the show many questions the status quo remains nearly the same and mulder and scully not get together rating four and half out five stars for the best movie yet this summer several jump right out your seat thrills many whoah never saw that one coming moments four holy shit where the hell did that come from and one heck ending you may wonder where this movie lost half star well swore never give movie the full five stars had find something about the his ice truck the tracks leaves

but the director realized that matter how pedestrian the prose this book really grabbed people that the author while not great writer was fantastic storyteller took the project convinced could make something happen screen the director francis ford coppola the book course was mario puzo the godfather the rest they say showbiz was history bringing the godfather don mean suggest that robert altman the gingerbread man destined for that level greatness but the parallel does suggest that possible create great cinema from questionable source material can you get any more questionable than john grisham depends whom you ask but there question that grisham work grabs people like puzo grisham better storyteller than writer unlike fellow hack michael crichton who good idea man but who can tell well constructed story from can spam something grisham unpublished story cocky savannah lawyer who gets involved deadly family squabble drew the attention robert altman who years old remains one america greatest living filmmakers the result gripping thriller that while falling short classic cinema deserves its place the altman canon from its opening shot the closing credits the gingerbread

never considers that has bitten off more than can chew until has swallow and then too late the plot unfolds magruder learns that none are secure think are and life never bad that can get worse you familiar with altman work you recognize several his signature techniques characters are not introduced establishing shots but rather are allowed wander the background scenes until their importance becomes apparent crucial scenes are shot from the outside through windows making the audience unwitting voyeurs the action dialog overlaps and the actors seem slip naturally into improvisational style and course there favorite altman technique the obligatory nude actress shot thanks altman here are some the actresses had the pleasure seeing naked sally kellerman julianne moore madeline stowe even frances mcdormand and now can add embeth davidtz who looks quite healthy the altogether the naked actress shot has become ubiquitous the altman film the director cameo was the hitchcock film old school sexism clever joke you the judge but back the picture hand the hands mere mortal the gingerbread man would have been routine thriller better worse than the countless others all endured the hands master like altman becomes exercise existential doom its own way far more successful than scorsese cape fear remake which tried for the same result what may prevent from enduring with altman greatest work weak third act fact there really third act grisham story appears that altman had throw the hurricane just jazz things but there are true moments riveting suspense and great performances branagh davidzt and downey more than enough see you through that polygram hated this picture that they tried steal final cut from altman and then buried the marketing campaign when won back should tell you how utterly clueless quality most studios are they probably wanted look more like time kill and that friends should make you very afraid

john replies with know you think you the thing beatrice not overt with her criticisms but instead gives them that mothering way which tantamount nit picking and guilt loading the kind that goes something like yes dear think you that wonderfully but seems though nothing does makes her happy there always the big but john believes that his mother somehow connected his failed relationships with

acting retirement play beatrice but the former actress and first lady could not leave her husband who was beginning show symptoms alzheimer disease that may just well since reynolds lends softness the character which enhances immensely rob morrow also does good job playing the younger brother who has always been mother favorite and for all his success his job and family slowly exposed mama boy the

amateurishly written film ever released through major studio producer dean devlin and director roland emmerich should ashamed themselves and penance forced return film school watch last year merienbad until they can grasp the idea content and plot amount hype amount money can hide the fact that these filmmakers are the 90s equivalent william beaudine billy the kid dracula godzilla opens with stock footage the bikini atoll nuclear tests interspersed with footage iguanas playfully swimming and nuzzling their eggs are then introduced the crew japanese fish canning ship questionable enterprise considering that tuna processing supposed supervised eliminate the netting dolphins well the ship attacked and sunk unseen creature later group frenchmen led philippe roache jean reno interview the sole survivor state shock the only thing the man can utter the word gojira the japanese name the famed beast are then introduced nick tatopoulos matthew broderick with moniker obviously taken from the effects designer the film currently studying the effects that the chernobyl disaster has had the local earthworm population immediately drafted the military and taken panama where shown the huge footprints creature short amount time another fishing boat loaded with canned tuna from the and korea for some reason found grounded jamaica well seems that whatever eating these ships headed for new york when the beast finally appears tears one building stomps couple trucks and makes life hell for the incumbent mayor ebert thumbs for new york the military with tatopoulos help have two tons fresh fish dumped the middle new york lure the beast out its hiding place the new york subway system finally comes crashing through the city streets and has cute face face with tatopoulos who snaps the beast picture the monster eats the fish the military starts shooting and the chase with the army causing the ensuing damage working from hunch why godzilla has decided come the big apple totopoulos buys few home pregnancy kits from local drugstore that has chosen remain open even though new york has been evacuated well the test proves that the monster hermaphrodite and pregnant needless say one believes the good doctor about his discovery must join with the renegade french secret service agents and find the monster nesting site and destroy the eggs before the mayor starts letting the populous back into the city even though the monster isn dead yet sincerely hope that completely spoiled any interest anyone might have seeing this film gave away the relevant plot that could spare those you courageous foolish enough drop down hour wage this tripe everything about godzilla reeks almost bad the piles rotting fish used trap the beast the script and let clear here devlin and emmerich full plot holes and non characters sure the recipient next years razzie award the dialogue between maria pitillo audrey timmonds tatopoulos estranged girlfriend and broderick adolescent makes teenagers giggle disbelief happened during the screening witnessed the film could enjoyably campy didn take itself damn seriously but what end there commentary humanities foibles against nature nor there any reference about godzilla being some sort retaliation against mankind godzilla just big dummy that got knocked some french immigrants and decided let the state new york pay for the film bleak and ugly looking taking place night during rain storm the movie has little depth everything ugly and dark new york has never looked inhospitable since death wish attempt give the film some color audrey timmonds carries bright red umbrella which unique that everyone else the film carries the standard gray issue the only moment composition and color during the brief scenes jamaica where tatopoulos finds himself standing giant footprint the scene nicely photographed but poorly set you know from the outset that nick standing footprint for scientist this very poor observation let look some the more interesting plot holes the film this activity becoming almost popular the kevin bacon game why does the french nuclear tests only affect one clutch iguana eggs and how those eggs fuse into one beast why would cold blooded creature choose cold climate such new york nest don think iguana have habit migrating how can godzilla crawl through the new york subway system slice submarine half yet unable extricate himself from some thin comparison steel cable the brooklyn bridge the brooklyn bridge the only suspension bridge existence that does not need suspension cables did godzilla carry all two hundred eggs her belly then radioactive mutations surely are wondrous creatures note each egg feet tall and almost wide godzilla would have over 000 feet tall carry them all godzilla can crush ships and eat helicopters but new york cabs are made stronger steel godzilla can out maneuver helicopters bullets torpedoes and missiles but can catch you foot taxis can out maneuver godzilla godzilla can burrow through the subway system but can tear through the park avenue tunnel why was nothing else mutated the nuclear test quickly godzilla maybe giant hermit crab the sequel galapagos iguana actually live the french polynesian islands why was tatopoulos brought the military they were not going listen him anyway how did they evacuate new york island less than day and how did they convince those new yorkers new jersey new york television stations use vhs tape for both filming and broadcasting new yorkers hate beta cam could and but that would only serve make the film seem more enjoyable than don fooled this film has less gray matter than any episode america funniest home videos the performances the film are singularly bland not one performance belays any awe fear the face this two hundred foot tall terror the characters the midst the onslaught have time stop and discuss the lack good coffee failed relationships career choices the only common occurrence that doesn take place here having one the characters have bowel movement but then that would have made them believable godzilla for the most part okay the design the beast funky not very memorable one thing that comes mind the major redirection godzilla this film remove his most familiar trademark namely his atomic breath now for one can quite fathom how you can call this monster godzilla without that little trait good comparison would make superman film and eliminate his ability fly there much wrong with this film that can really recall anything recently that has left this cold hearted except for divorce any film that can have two ton lizard slipping gum balls has got envisioned under the influence prozac the addition the baby raptors meant godzillas are nothing but direct rip off jurassic park but with none that film suspense tension suffice say that godzilla without doubt the most brain dead motion picture the decade this film that needed the hype with the current level writing and directing nothing else about the film succeeds you seen the trailers you seen the best parts only suggestion for and that they could always back selling shoes this film could the next rocky horror only not funny

meaningful issues the iron giant which was directed and written brad bird late such animated series the simpsons and king the hill assumes that not only can children handle such discussions but that they can while being entertained the same time the iron giant holds absolutely contempt for the young people the audience making film that enjoyable for both children and adults alike hogarth hughes voice eli marienthal spirited young lad who lives with his hard working single mother annie jennifer aniston small town maine after staying late and watching scary movies night his mother away hogarth treks out into the forest investigate what has stolen his antenna and ruined his reception comes across giant robot vin diesel from space that eats metal for food after saving the robot nicknamed the iron giant from electric shock hogarth befriends the creature and takes him pet sorts because damage suffered upon landing the giant has forgotten what his original mission was just follows hogarth around like lost puppy realizing can just keep the giant barn all the time and that the giant needs food takes him junkyard owned dean harry connick eccentric artist who assembles sculptures out scrap iron his spare time soon becomes apparent that dean and hogarth can keep the giant secret forever because government spook named kent mansley christopher mcdonald has been brought investigate mysterious sightings the surrounding forest area and considers the giant threat national security suspects hogarth knows something about the giant and takes residence hogarth house lodger meanwhile the giant begins exhibit ominous behavior that suggests was built weapon some kind the iron giant exactly what family films ought because doesn talk down its audience the story simple very simple about alien being that drops out the sky and befriends young boy very similar the spielberg classic and such comparisons are actually deserved the case the iron giant the film holds many the better elements spielberg film such the ability sentimental without turning sappy the film delivers several serious messages the most important which one ability choose one own fate hogarth teaches the giant against his programming and become what wants hero the final sequence touching and appropriate though won give away will say that very few will disappointed the animation while not disney standards what could after tarzan good enough make you forget you watching cartoon the giant computer animated while the human characters are all hand drawn the old fashioned way the characters faces are done quite well drawn realistically enough make the personalities credible but the features are exaggerated allow for the cartoonish expressions that provide for comic relief fine voice work turned young eli marienthal hogarth and jennifer aniston surprisingly convincing his waitress mother harry connick does nice characterization dean and really enjoyed the voice work john mahoney frasier army general called agent mansley unlike several cartoon features each character actually developed personality rather than stereotype and actually integral the plot rather than being superfluous comic relief sidekick clich disney still hasn ditched dean for example could have been stereotypical beatnik his character profile seems suggest that but presented character with real emotions thoughts and motivations even the heavy agent mansley not villain who does bad things simply because wants but out his own fear and paranoia lesser animated feature would have drawn paper thin stereotypes and figure the kids won mind but the iron giant has clearly put little work into making the characters real and pays off the film isn only around deliver heavy handed messages though also very funny and the humor the kind that both children and adults will enjoy the scenes which hogarth teaches the giant certain things such dive into pool are handled well and director brad bird clearly has sense comic timing having worked the simpsons for many years sequence where hogarth and mansley attempt outlast one another trying stay awake very nicely timed and also extremely clever the film even takes some jabs america nuclear paranoia during the early stages the cold war satirizing the lame safety films shown grade school students that tell them duck and cover the event nuclear attack the iron giant has much more satirical edge than most family films and the edgy humor actually quite refreshing instead seeing people get bonked the head get well timed clever gags that seem have required some imagination come with when you get right down the iron giant more than the story boy and his robot the story straightforward quaint that ultimately becomes charming though enjoy the complex plotting film noir much the next person when comes family entertainment simple the way akin one those bedtime stories your father told that had you hanging his every word but not the story that sets the film above others its kind but rather the elements that into the story namely real characters and thoughtful dialogue which the iron giant has spades

show and for god sake mike nichols directed the graduate and annette bening just walking away from american beauty explain this this thing what planet are you from purports comedy exploring the relationship between men and women satirizing the whole pop psychology mars venus phenomenon but what this movie winds being collection unfunny cringe inducing moments coupled with uninsightful cringe inducing moments the end result unsurprisingly unfunny uninsightful cringe inducing thoroughly icky embarrassment garry shandling plays alien from planet populated technologically advanced but emotionally vacant males they reproduce through cloning course his leaders put select group males through series tests designed determine which one most fit fly off earth find female the species and impregnate her they taught how pretend that they listening nodding and saying huh and how compliment shoes imagine delighted surprise when heavens all their carefully practiced tactics turn out fail miserably producing comedic results the lucky winner fitted with penis since theirs after generations disuse have long since shrunk out existence will restrain myself from mentioning the implausibility such scenario since the population has stopped evolving due the fact that they all just clones whoops too late the penis when aroused tends make humming noise the writers when frequently strapped for ideas tend turn this source comedy isn funny the first time isn funny the eighth time isn funny the eighteenth time anything made feel vaguely self conscious garry meets with coworker bank played greg kinnear who turns out generic unlikable scumbag meant fill the part unfortunate role model for shandling alien character but flatly drawn that even the writers quickly give

bastard nearly every man the movie fact played the same sort sex driven slimeball when kinnear wife walks into the office there isn single guy who doesn trip bump into wall otherwise pratfall they

inevitably prove the love never knew existed one kinnear meetings shandling mission have baby and when reveals his desires her bening instantly falls for him and the next day they get married yup the next day cuz see turns out she wants baby too bening character perhaps was the most difficult watch especially after seeing her come apart the seams effectively american beauty her character here supposed representing the female the species whole then woe say the species she unfathomably insecure and succumbs easily all shandling lines and lies that borders tragic there point where after thinking she may not able bear children she learns that she indeed pregnant when garry comes home after nearly cheating her she strolls into the kitchen and sings high hopes you know the uplifting ant and the rubber tree plant song deliver the news and then says him now you can leave supposed empathize with shandling discovery the feeling guilt but instead wanted weep for bening that she was placing her entire life and soul firmly the lap great big nothing and eventually shandling falls love with her for real suppose though not sure exactly what prompted what the message derive from all this men are liars inherently empty creatures but you hang around long enough well maybe something will click thankful such broad cynicism isn frequently allowed run rampant let all join hands and pray that the planet these folks are from not this one there also subplot involving john goodman airline incident investigator that wades the bog stupidity goodman through series astoundingly implausible realizations puts together the fact that shandling being from another world with magic vibrating penis has all the makings for subplot having shandling discovered that thankfully never comes the inevitable hackneyed fruition instead just dangles limply the branch for while withers and falls away further proof that goodman should just stick doing coen brothers movies but let not dwell this any longer already wasted plenty your time and own let move forget about what seen here and get with our lives and help out let end things happy note congratuations out annette bening

happened detail becomes real education what agencies get involved and how theories are suggested and what kind pressure the investigators are under and just about any other aspect you can think frequently get the feeling that the article sounded exciting but being told more detail than really wanted know often get the middle story and say sounded good but now have invested more time than willing spend this subject film different medium visual medium that slows down the telling stories much more than people realize frequently surprised find out how short film script and how much the pages are empty space the magazine article and the film script are two very different media the insider film adaptation the vanity fair article the man who knew too much marie brenner too much adaptation magazine article slowed the pace film really verges being tedious least times for years the seven big companies knew that they dealt addictive drug that caused host unhealthy side effects but they pretended for the public that was unproven and they did not really believe the business was incredibly profitable and the proceeds translated into the political power squelch and discredit any political movements against big tobacco the tide turned when former vice president one the companies was convinced the cbs minutes news team tell the public how much the tobacco companies really knew about the health effects smoking the resulting pressure stop the story created small civil war cbs who were the major people involved what were their motives how was the story almost killed how did get aired anyway that the story covered surprising detail the insider this all could have been enthralling but not the sort thing that stylist like michael mann would likely well and the end failed make long story short the film needed director who knew how make long story short the film opens with the cbs minutes team iran with the assignment interview terrorist get taste for their personal style and how they get the upper hand they from being one newsman blindfolded the hands the terrorists the actual interview with mike wallace played christopher plummer there the news team under producer lowell bergman pacino are ordering around the terrorists and getting away with this seems have nothing with the main line the story but later when the tobacco industry much harder manipulate than committed terrorists have wry irony who really has clout the world terrorists can grab the headlines but the tobacco companies have the real position power incongruously intercut with the iran interview sequence see jeffrey wigand russell crowe dejectedly returning from work his home discover that has been fired and his career brought complete halt unexpectedly had been very profitably rewarded vice president charge research and development brown and williams tobacco now was unemployed and needed money support his family rather than support him his wife liane diane venora

wigand severance agreement swears him secrecy about anything knows about tobacco dealings but reluctantly stretches the severance terms willing read some documents from another tobacco company and interpret them for bergman spite the secrecy wigand former employers seem immediately know wigand talking minutes and warned off former boss thomas sandefur played michael gambon all too brief but deliciously sinister role and the game begins wigand irate his negative treatment for what still considered continued loyalty his agreement and his former employer meanwhile someone playing very rough with wigand and his family the film examines wigand and the pressures placed his family they are caught between two powerful giants wigand has always wanted make tobacco safer and has natural sympathies with getting the story out and his family are assaulted psychologically and financially the giant tobacco industry that had never lost legal fight pacino given top billing but the wigand family the core the insider the story told slowly and just bit too much meticulous detail the film 157 minutes and extremely demanding film for the audience the musical score pieter bourke lisa gerrard and graeme revell one the worst recent memory puts ominous chords under some scenes and using voice ways that become distraction that gets the way the storytelling also disturbing the casting christopher plummer mike wallace plummer and wallace are such different types and wallace too well known for even good actor plummer play him convincingly this film might have been really engaging

back school after having viewed titanic however found well paced well designed and overall well made movie there have been many films made about the maiden and final voyage the ocean liner titanic but this latest offering from director james cameron the best seen titanic tells its story two time periods starts out the present when ocean explorer brock lovett bill paxton and his team are exploring

life and charmingly able handle variety situations girls are going swoon over him winslet also proves herself good actress delivering her lines convincingly and the quality performances between winslet and dicaprio makes the relationship believable the only problem with winslet that she does not carry herself accordance with her character upbringing simply judgment her gait was distracted

1 |text seen july 1998 the crossgates cinema albany theater with mom using hoyts cinema cash theater rating very good sound picture and seats very rare that any medium entertainment can give one authentic vivid sense reality and life all stories are about select moments time and places the characters lives but only the truly great ones are able define their realities well enough the audience can experience just the characters therefore gone with the wind deserves accolades for its ability tell the epic story does such crafted intricate and entertaining manner crowning achievement not only filmmaking but for storytelling itself the film takes place georgia before during and after the civil war this plays major factor the film success use such historic setting presents many possibilities and problems since one was alive the time verify its accuracy might also seem cliche boring and other such deterent factors potential viewers can story set long ago relatable now the film confronts all these problems paradoxically not cronfronting them doesn simply plug the right thing the right time creates entire reality where everything makes sense and said concerns are irrelevant building strong foundation important all forms media without which what there build given some backstory here and learn little about our characters especially our main character scarlett hara leigh beautiful southern belle with will steel cunning wit and tremendous sense liberty such oppressive time she knows how her society works wherein everything she does can and will play role the shaping her life and those around her right from the beginning realize how determined she have her way matter what the consequences may being the most sought after woman allows her manipulate men and their women ensure she gets her way whether obvious who will the one get her food subtle getting married just spite someone the man she claims love ashley wilkes howard modest gentleman who does not seem have the same passion for her she does for him isn arrogant and demanding scarlett fact engaged woman with personality much more like his her name melanie havilland and she one the sweetest kindest and most likable characters one will ever see she and scarlett become very dear friends but she never suspects the jealously scarlett has for her and the love she has for her husband her meekness both her strongest and weakest characteristic defines who she but doesn give her much emotional self defense acting catalyst the love triangle and the story whole the daper stong willed cunning cocky southern business and military man captain rhett butler gable quite character all right everyone listens what has say even though got bad reputation butler makes apologies for his vast amount money nor his behavior tells everyone the much needed truth the rigid caste like society where freewill doesn seem exist everything done out honor and tradition for example his first appearance butler tells his fellow southerners there way the south could defeat the north war were break out this angers them not for his lack faith but because has the gall say aloud and boastfully that have ammunition factories have food have navy all have tobacco all true statements and yet the south still insists wrong butler shifty character sure but takes such pride his arrogance appealing scarlett notices this too when she first sees him and from the look butler gives her know not going stop until has her but scarlett can get past her need for ashley and during scene which sets the stage for the grand story butler learns this and continues throw back scarlett forever and the story goes with scarlett being thrown obstacle after obstacle her life the conflicts she must overcome range from taking care her entire family finding proper husband especially after she marked for life when her first husband dies this gives the film many opportunities bring more characters into the epic story some are vital for only few scenes but their true signifcance will endure throughout the film most films only few characters exist for support background but this film more realistic and believable incorporates supporting cast the size small town and everyone has signficance even people the background seem more than just extras wandering the set the costuming design outstanding that the film makes for real sense time and place the filmmakers could have easily set more scenes indoors and narrowly focused avoid having show the outside real world but these types simple approaches are never taken the first half the film depicts the traumatic experience the south faced the last days the civil war fleming able convey the horror all painting image destruction and letting the viewer decide just how bad one scene has scarlett working nurse military hospital while hear soldier the background screaming not leg don cut off leg another scene shows her simplying trying cross street but the camera pulls back see that her path blocked hundreds wounded soldiers but their moaning that more graphic than all the bloody gore could ever the second half begins the film concentrates more scarlett completely independent woman who single handedly takes care her family and melanie just spite the tyrany the north she manages resurrect the family plantation but all the willpower she has can help her when she must pay exuberhant taxes set the north after the south ultimate defeat this brings rhett butler back into the picture and thus begins their torrid love hate relationship most the second half the film somehow related the relationship lack thereof between rhett and scarlett each uses the other for personal gain but the same time they still feel intimate connection with each other scarlett continues use her manipulative powers over men get what she wants and because rhett can help but want her more every time she tries one him such marrying another man and taking over his business they say opposites attract but the conflict between rhett and scarlett goes way beyond opposing personalities borders magnetic polarization they need each other and know this yet they never seem truly happy together perhaps they mistake love for passion and the film leaves make this call both have things the other wants and vice versa but when they compromise just get their own way because they actually care for each other love and the perception love are two completely separate things and throughout the final act the film left wondering rhett and scarlett ever truly loved each other and why gable and leigh have great chemistry always leaving the viewer wondering which emotions were authentic and which were manufacture all none either way possible and mystery that cannot solved even upon repeated viewings safe say most won live such overly dramatic lives those gone with the wind but still masterpiece for its ability give sense that just experienced life worth joy and pain

1 |text contact nobly intentioned but ultimately unsatisfying adaptation carl sagan only novel details the circumstances surrounding the first clear sign intelligent life outer space and their effects the life young and idealistic radio astronomer named ellie arroway jodie foster first meet ellie giant radio telescope puerto rico where she part the seti search for extraterrestrial intelligence project her research quickly killed however her highly political david drumlin tom skerrit who disdains pure research favor science with commercial applications she goes search private funding and turned down every step until she pitches her project corporation run the mysterious hadden john hurt then with that money just about finally dry ellie sitting out the desert near the very large array new mexico when she hears over her headphones very powerful pulsing radio signal the movie most exciting and believable sequence ellie and her coworkers determine that the signal has coming from the star vega first the signal appears just sequences prime numbers then turns out signal the berlin olympics bounced back earth from years before further decoding with hadden help reveals another layer message containing detailed plans for massive and complex machine appears that the machine transport that will allow one person travel the aliens home world course the big question becomes who gets ride right after who gonna pay for this thing boil down ellie gets denied the seat the machine because she bluntly acknowledges her atheism while drumlin gets because rather insincerely professes his deep religious faith drumlin killed and the machine destroyed when religious fanatics bomb the launch platform apparently keep godless science from talking god something like that then hadden reappears with startling news has secretly constructed second machine off the coast japan and has reserved the ride for ellie whom has taken rather paternal interest ellie boards the machine and transported through some kind wormhole dream like place that looks lot like waikiki beach before they built the hotels where she meets the aliens who take the form her late father david morse when she returns home one believes her she was not even gone for one second they say even though she remembers being gone for hours her story officially discredited although believed large segment the public who don even have know that her computer records the trip contain nothing but static eighteen hours worth static there lot like about contact will highlight those points first ellie arroway well rounded character portrayed one the best actresses currently working neither the character nor the performance has the same depth clarice starling silence the lambs but that tough standard meet ellie interesting that she woman defined strange array father figures her real father idealized movie dad who does nothing the film but love his daughter unconditionally drumlin comes across distant stepfather whom ellie like irritating teenager who wants use his toys get into trouble hadden obviously has affection for ellie but the end seems see her his creation nothing more than his favorite piece the chess board even palmer joss matthew mcconaughey ellie love interest takes paternalistic interest ellie seeing her misguided person who needs protection from her own impulses the film technically impressive especially the scenes where the message first received and during the destruction the first machine the part the film dealing with the message has the best presentation real science film since the andromeda strain the film falls apart when dealing with its central theme the dichotomy between science and religion this very real debate but contact boils down simplistic level that never really touches the actual issues involved the film presents science pretty well until the end the real problem stems from presentation religious faith religious people are presented shallow caricatures rob lowe plays ralph reed clone named richard rank very subtle guys the voice the religious right another religious figure the fanatic who blows the first machine jake busey the only really fleshed out religious person palmer joss supposed minister some sort but his actual faith left pretty vague can even say for certain that was supposed christian all know that dropped out the seminary and obviously has qualms about pre marital sex the film drops the science ball the very end when ellie appears assert that there are some things even scientists must take faith day and age when the theory evolution denounced the religion right atheist religious doctrine this exactly the wrong message send movie dealing with issues science and faith the last thing you want your scientist character abandon the principle scientific skepticism what ellie should have said was you shouldn believe not without evidence and don have the evidence know what happened but you shouldn take word alone that the voice science speaking the character david drumlin another problem with this film his attitudes toward pure research project seem out place for person his position also his profession faith before the selection committee nakedly and transparently insincere that only pack idiots should have fallen for the last big problem with the use real personalities various roles the media figures such bernard shaw and jay leno aren bad much their participation was voluntary the use bill clinton however should give anyone pause first all lifting the image sitting head state and inserting him into fictional story line thus using his words outside the context which they were spoken just plain creepy also using the real president places this film between 1993 and 2001 forever dating people watching this film the future will say hey this never took place during clinton term this bit unreality will jar people out their suspension disbelief also the level technology portrayed the film too advanced take place before the first decade the next century better have had fictitious president played actor president all the film does raise interesting question although never develops satisfying way were picking emissary send alien culture would atheist automatically disqualified just because ninety percent the population the world professes belief god least some form

-1 |text seemed like the perfect concept what better for the farrelly brothers famous for writing and directing comedies with offensive subject matter than make movie about guy with split personality exactly the sort thing the brothers relish poking fun something serious this case mental illness throwing all care the wind get laugh jim carrey signed too even better the national alliance for the mentally ill even helped out levying complaints against the brothers new film before its opening claiming was misrepresenting the condition split personality labeling incorrectly schizophrenia and forth such protest seemed like just the sort thing that would course only add more fuel the farrelly brothers fire proving that some people just couldn take joke and that the farrellys would helping the more enlightened viewers yet another dose their brilliantly subversive comedy yes all seemed perfect but one thing went wrong their movie isn funny not for lack trying the farrellys utilize myself irene their most high concept premise ever carrey plays charlie baileygaites man who after being dumped his wife for midget limo driver decides bury all his aggressive feelings deep down inside and never release them this course means all his neighbors exploit his entirely too forgiving nature making his job rhode island state trooper increasingly difficult soon enough charlie repressed aggression manifests itself into second independent personality named hank deep voiced boorish ogre unafraid taking the assertive actions his predecessor had been unable muster this guy isn above crashing car through the wall the barber shop which been insulted holding little girl head underwater because she refused stop jump roping the street then things start getting lost the most complicated plot the farrellys have ever attempted and the film runs off its tracks some have suggested that this isn problem because the farrelly brothers brand humor doesn require plot work they wrong course plot was greatly instrumental building the kind rollicking comic energy that infused the farrellys last effort 1996 there something about mary 1999 outside providence was technically earlier project the brothers earlier film wasn funny merely because contained outrageous gags despite what some newsmagazine articles would have you believe but rather because its most outrageous gags were entirely unexpected mary the farrellys managed several times pull off neat sleight hand trick they have you thinking the story was going one way then reveal its real direction delightfully surprising fashion myself irene contrast seems have been made folks who looked mary and saw only the surface grossness missing all the subtle machinations that really made work having been produced the same guys who made mary irene seems like even bigger disappointment the brothers pile the offensive humor taking shots race midgets albinos mental illness and all manner bathroom jokes but they haven come with way make any fresh most myself irene comes off rote the numbers adolescent comedy the plot with carrey forced drive alleged fugitive irene waters renee zellweger who more trouble than anyone knows back new york has ending that entirely predictable from the get think charlie and irene will fall love yeah too the farrellys then introduce scores different characters and none them ever manage anything you haven already expected them matter how outrageous their actions might compared the curveballs the farrellys are used throwing this stuff almost entirely soft tossed presenting obvious problem when gross out humor loses its shock value longer funny merely gross the jokes that work are milked over and over until their effectiveness runs dry take for example the subplot involving charlie three black sons anthony anderson mongo brownlee jerod mixon the incongruity all funny for while with three burly black men discussing higher math ghetto language and white bread carrey mouthing said language with entirely too pleasant smile his face but the end the film they still doing the same schitck hasn been elevated another funnier level and hasn been dropped either that too bad because ceases amusing about halfway through myself irene reeks wasted opportunities there ought more focus how other people react charlie new personality and how charlie deals with the consequences hank actions this doesn really happen nearly every supporting character learns about charlie condition early they don have any opportunity surprised the film throws what looks like patented farrelly curve scene towards the midway point involving albino companion charlie and irene pick called appropriately whitey but the script doesn anywhere with instead leaving the thread twisting the wind before awkwardly tying during the climax jim carrey gifted comedian both physically and vocally but left with nothing much here except contort himself manner similar steve martin all great showcase flexibility and split second role shifting but none terribly funny carrey doesn pull any stunts don expect him pull and the farrellys script doesn give him anything else pull the situations which must perform the role shifting aren set any meaningful way perhaps carrey can take solace the fact that his supporting actors fare better zellweger irene not strong female lead mary mary may have been part adolescent fantasy but she was also intelligent and strong willed irene nothing particular the film never makes clear whether she ditzy clever neither such she gives nothing latch onto the only sane person the film chris cooper stuck playing exactly one note corrupt fbi agent and his character entirely too straight laced for movie like this like the others does absolutely nothing unexpected after viewing the shapeless mess that myself irene eventually dissolved into was stuck wondering whether not the farrellys had outsmarted themselves maybe their kind comedy can only work for long until audiences get wise and stop being shocked but don believe good filmmakers find ways surprising their audiences even after people have grown attuned their style the farrellys are indeed good smart filmmakers and still think they are they rebound just fine even after that happens though still consider myself irene high caliber misfire

1 |text director david fincher has such eye for detail which very rare hollywood these days terry gilliam comes mind another one film one the best art forms because not only can you tell story but you can use the camera capture the smallest detail and have mean something but most directors seem for action with the slightest ounce story whenever director uses the camera its fullest potential the film almost automatically deserves good review and when they add fascinating story you have nearly perfect entertainment fincher the game exception this the game one the most interesting and complex films come out hollywood long time fincher hasn made film since seven his box office and critical hit which defied expectations and became one the best movies ever about time made another film and what ride the game isn quite powerful seven but some ways better overall the game could have used little more clarity little more uncertainty walks line insanity and reality but never goes either way until the very end the outcome satisfying enough for the preceding events and makes lot sense once everything set straight unfortunately unlike the usual suspects are never given enough information figure out for ourselves what happening whether true false however this also gives the film frightening aspect which the game uses the fullest extent the game told completely from its main character point view nicholas van orton michael douglas high strung and isolated businessman lives alone his giant mansion divorced from his wife elizabeth and celebrating his 48th birthday the same age which his father committed suicide the same mansion for his 48th birthday conrad sean penn the rebel the family gives nicholas gift certificate crs consumer recreation services will make your life fun again his brother promises skeptical nicholas somewhat intrigued and annoyed the lack information something this businessman hates seeing billboard office decides visit the mysterious company jim feingold james rebhorn greets nicholas and guides him through the sign process which consists psych tests physicals emotional responses and other mind games each game suited each person emotional and psychological needs explains feingold one day nicholas gets call from crs and they explain that failed the tests even more intrigued and now somewhat angered the time spent signing starts asking around see what people can tell him about the company what doesn realize that the game has already begun the phone call just the first many strange events thrown nicholas way how finds out that involved has witnessed because amusing and fun and visually impressive the detail involved fincher shots incredible and almost requires second viewing just appreciate the effort that went into them with seven fincher had almost every single shot mean something also has the unique ability make you look exactly what wants you compared seven though the game light and comical because this film sense humor and self awareness nothing can taken quite seriously don try make much sense what goes the game because doesn want you what does make sense the final revelation when everything becomes apparent and clear taken the game ending makes complete sense but you try and critique every minute detail then you get yourself into plot holes and incredibility perhaps that the reason docked the film while trying remain realistic and plausible the plot too unbelievable create any real tension screen don really care douglas character lives not because isn believable the ending requires you have believed anything that has happened previously but you suspend disbelief and take the film you can accept the game emotionally and psycholically disturbing thriller michael douglas gives terrific performance nicholas douglas has played lonely businessmen before but here adds another level his performance his character who normally level headed and relies facts forced trust nobody can believe the waitress bumped into what about his brother who got him involved the game the first place douglas portrays this aspect his character extremely well and gives one his best performances even better than his falling down persona the supporting cast essential this film and casting was critical sean penn always good and gives yet another credible performance douglas brother deborah kara unger from crash the waitress bumps into and her performance extremely good fact she almost steals the film from douglas james rebhorn portrays his character very well and adds some confusion and desparation douglas predicament another good performance comes from armin mueller stahl from shine the book editor but considering that douglas every single scene the game not only commands this cast but makes this distant and lonely character come colorful life the game rated for language violence some gore and some nudity and drugs what essential for this film work the writing john brancato and michael ferris have woven confusing and compelling screenplay with witty dialogue and some very funny moments this screenplay will probably get oscar nomination for best original screenplay because does almost exactly the same thing the usual suspects did however the visuals the game are enough make the viewer enjoy the vexing plot and you can get yourself believe everything occuring the screen you will thoroughly entertained one this year best films

1 |text since most movies about slavery shield from the true horrors what they portraying fitting say that beloved come real shock film confusing bizarre and tough film watch any film seen all year and that not necessarily because the three hour running time beloved challenging watch filled with tough and powerful poetry that takes completely off guard and instead straight forward hollywood ized story about what happened the slaves after they were freed beloved comes off cry anguish from all those who actually lived through what happened rather toni morrison who wrote the novel upon which this based beloved tells the story slave named sethe played oprah winfrey who lives large farm the north with her children when the film opens her house being terrorized poltergeist which shakes things wounds the dog and makes things generally uncomfortable for the family sethe proud though and will not move her sons run away leaving only her and her daughter denver kimberly elise alone with the ghost which there without any factual explanation couple years pass and the ghost remains and one day man named paul danny glover another slave who knew sethe years ago when they worked plantation together arrives asking for lodging has been wandering around since left the plantation and when enters the house turns red and becomes incredibly hot when remarks about what thinks evil sethe replies ain evil just sad some more time passes and paul has become fervent member the household and the ghost disappears but when they return one day from going out they discover young woman sitting the house her name beloved and played thandie newton she has almost zero motor skills she stumbles around half grabbing onto things and knocking them over and when she speaks she lets out low guttural sound that eventually turns into baby talk they let her into her house and she begins turn things upside down beloved acts like incredibly difficult chamber drama paired with ghost story most the scenes consist people arguing one claustrophobic low lit room with the occasional flash the past where see images such horror that thank god for modern day psychoanalysts sethe and paul have lived through such hellish times that they are forever implanted with the memories their slavehood the old plantation which includes such images sethe being raped the white plantation hands with her nipples being licked prompting her cry out paul when reminiscing about they took milk worst all was the month after her freedom when she was allowed live like free person working with other blacks farm and then seeing that her old plantation owners have arrived presumedly take her and her children back she runs the barn near carrying her four children and when her old owners burst they discover she has murdered one them and ready murder the rest them they don leave them alone when she inquired about this moment paul moment halfway through the film she says she doesn regret she killed her daughter that she would not have live through the horror she did and she has convinced herself she did the right thing course beloved really her daugher materialized though aren flat out told that until later the film beloved represents the pain and suffering the slaves went through and shows how difficult was for them deal with their freedom after being tortured for long thus beloved becomes sorta redux the andrei tarkofsky sci classic solaris where cosmonaut discovers that his wife who commited suicide years before has materialized when orbiting over planet with complex brain system that film spoke volumes about humanity and our memories how are constantly regretting what happened the past and when ever literally came back haunt would control completely beloved moves along freely without lot explanation and for the most part this extremely respectable the most interesting films are the ones that don explain everything for leaving gaps the characters that are supposed fill with how they act the present tense sethe never fully explained character but understand all her actions since she being played oprah winfrey been well over decade since her last major performance the color purple but judging from these two films bet she one the best actresses working today she was strictly actress her talk show which suppose great entity has prevented her from becoming noteworthy actress and that shame because she brings much this movie emotion sadness strength watching the strong sethe who afraid the past that she built rather strong protective coating around herself break down when she discovers who beloved really what makes this movie really great she makes real that not say this perfect film fact wager say that the fact that confusing and painful watch what prevents this from being the truly great film while oprah performance powerful and easily sympathetic and dying see her win least oscar nomination this february the structure the film which doesn show what happened her children till halfway through the film prevents from really making cohesive connection the film doesn necessarily move though they memories one particular character and the end has lost control over sethe and she takes bed are unable truly identify with her anymore but despite its tediousness perhaps that the point the distancing the end the film may just part the way has been built from the start since they figure she has crossed over from being identifiable and needs get back with reality and for the most part this film seems like the cry pain from the slaves that really wants jonathan demme direction bizarre nature with the story and creates the right mood making tough film sit through making sure that the audience feels uncomfortable the characters there more admire here like the way that the flashbacks pop freely and without real organization just like they would real life and the way that the ending leaves somewhat open more pain and suffering but laced with touch optimism the acting not only from winfrey amazing and anticipate not only she will get oscar nomination everyone has been raving about thandie newton performance and how should rewarded however must noted that out everyone she had the easiest part act like baby throw things stumble around chew food with your mouth open think there another performance worthy oscar conisderation but kimberly elise the daugher who has stay sensible and sane and has carry the burden her mother loss reality towards the end not that newton isn great she annoying and wacky the role demands just that elise has the tougher job and pulls off even better despite the fact that this film has winfrey written all over and not that writer morrison director demme beloved has still not done well costing think around ninety million dollars has since grossed about twenty two unfortunately this film little too intense for viewers even for and can stand almost anything recently viewed the hour long epic caligula the worst film have

1 |text there one thing that bothers about hollywood films their predictable endings the devil advocate has the atypical hollywood ending when everything that should happen does unfortunately for the devil advocate this ending nearly collapses itself and ruins the entire film nevertheless the film does provide two and half hours pure entertainment note self kill whomever was charge the previews for this film don think was quite prepared for this movie because the trailers made appear some supernatural horror film about satan well does contain this element but what not mentioned the ads the other plot elements and seemingly more interesting ones that the devil advocate begins florida with ongoing trial session kevin lomax keanu reeves the defense attorney working for client whom has been accused raping young girl ends with not guilty verdict despite emotional testimony from the victim heather matarazzo leaves the courthouse with his lovely wife mary ann charlize theron where approached with offer travel new york city help choose good jury accepts mainly after seeing the paycheck will receive and flies new york with his wife after proving his worth for selecting juries and his perfect winning streak court the head the firm john milton pacino asks him work permanently criminal lawyer graciously accepts where treated almost god given incredible apartment which bigger than entire house now and hefty paycheck his life seems the rise and course his life suddenly begins waver and slowly decline attracted fellow employee christabella connie nielson and his wife begins feel very lonely her large apartment mary ann takes friendship with neighbor who always gives advice especially not wanted meanwhile kevin nabs case surrounding alexander cullen craig nelson who apparently murdered three people spends hours upon hours with this case while forgetting his loving wife who may may not going insane all this while john milton may may not the devil himself after while things turn completely upside down kevin wife claims have seen monstrous images superimposed her friends fellow employee murdered the park and his mother judith ivey reveals information about kevin real father all just big nightmare john milton really satan playing tricks with kevin life the devil advocate plays out fairly straight forward but for some odd reason the screenwriters wanted surprise everyone giving something don expect this surprise conclusion supposed make feel good and home without feeling depressed disturbed the devil advocate messes completely and ironically felt more depressed because the ending now than would have had ended ten minutes early went into the devil advocate expecting shocking horror film and that exactly what got was settled disturbed mentally and emotionally and that what got but what was the most disturbing and horrible aspect the movie the poor ending did mention that didn like the ending the producers this film take you thrilling roller coaster ride and just ending they pull the rug out from under you films like se7en and the usual suspects can survive with this surprise ending because expected more less know going end unpredictable way the devil advocate the other hand ends unpredictably not from knowing lot but knowing nothing all that confusing recommend watching the film and then reading that again for the film overall enjoyed the entire first two hours being drawn terrific character study and then adding the supernatural plot increase the tension build from the character study the film runs like well built clock slowly building until finally exploding with highly charged climax and unpredictable one that and then you settle for nice resolution which does not occur was this point that felt cheated taking terror ride intrigue follow kevin lomax around the centerpiece the film everything occurs from his perspective our representation screen sort but are forced witness conclusion which makes most the film seem like game don want spoil the ending all can say see the film and decide for yourself perhaps the most shocking thing about the devil advocate the extreme amount everything earned its rating for reason there plenty nudity sex violence gore and then you have gore violence sex and more nudity this film really isn subtle about anything showing everything actually surprises that this film did not receive rating quite harsh however the movie does have its merits and nudity and sex are among those don condone sex and nudity films but its there might well enjoy the biggest merit this film also the most interesting watch the confrontations between kevin lomax and john milton are entertaining but what stands out amidst this extreme hatred the decline the wife mary ann portrayed the extremely effective charlize theron mary ann problems are incredibly intense and found myself wanting witness her decline this may sound uncaring but wanted watch because felt sorry for her she the most interesting character the screen who forced into world where she not wanted something the devil advocate contained actually shocked for reasons other than extreme violence and nudity especially for film this nature the story actually has something say about humanity one the last scenes john milton explains kevin lomax the game god plays with his children satan course comments that human nature lust and loathe vanity then god sets rules which contradict human nature this semi religious bashing more humorous than frightening what milton says true about our society that found myself laughing out loud partially thinking was funny but patially realizing was true these moral dilemmas are present throughout the devil advocate giving added depth many films skip over their writing but sure they came straight from the novel was based when film has something say about our society deserves watched the cast the devil advocate one the highlights see memorable faces and they put spins those memorable faces don expect heather matarazzo makes brief appearance the terrorized victim the opening court case and she does great job probably the big surprise this film keanu reeves has proven himself uneven actor successes such speed and bombs such johnny mnemonic but tops himself with this performance have never seen him more believable date pacino course the scene stealer his devilish performance equal those jack nicholson the witches eastwick and max von sydow needful things could have easily gone too far over the top many scenes but remains completely believable that the correct term jeffrey jones mostly known the principal ferris bueller day off also gives good performance eddie barzoon judith ivey manages credible performance the mother who holds secret kevin past
