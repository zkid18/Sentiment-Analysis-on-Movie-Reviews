 |text well there goes another one sadly this like other movies this year wasn good this one being almost bad the omega code but not quite from the opening credits had good feeling this would bad and well guess was right with bad excuses for acting horrible screenplay and straight out bad direction the bachelor terribly unfunny movie that doesn work any levels accept that fact that rene zellwegar who does give good performance the two cameos brooke shields and mariah carey are also good with brooke being the best the movie troubled from the start because chris donnell hugely miscast and gives one the worst performances date here the stupid plot chris donnell plays jimmie shelton man who has just broken with his girlfriend meets anne rene zellwegar they instantly hit off and are together for three years jimmie decides that wants bring their relationship little bit really doesn realize that anne thinks wants marry her what wants never did catch proposes really bad way and she shoots him down and very mad course tries apologize but nothing seems help any then his grandfather dies and learns that has left jimmie 100 million dollars long marries before the next day now jimmie must find anne and try marry her get the money and because loves her get married someone else get the money itself leading funny and predictable ending that leaves bad taste our mouths maybe this could one the dumbest cliched silliest romantic comedy date that has real big laughs even the supporting roles artie lange hal holbrook and anser aren even good the plot was good idea but the script would have have been written less than five minutes and five year old the choppy dialogue and bad directing don help things any even though chris donnell gave performance the two batman movies does not give even remotely good funny performance here and wanted boo and throw pop the screen get rid him rene zelweggar different story and gave charming sweet and likable performance usual and really was the only thing that saved this confused movie from being total huge washout her sister played marley shelton also good and the two have good chemistry onscreen brooke shields showed funny little performance big headed mogul who after while became routine and old one really can help but think that have seen this stuff before not like this original idea and the end everyone knows what going happen due its cliches and typicalness the bachelor works good levels and fact doesn work all anser and hal holbrook were wasted terrible roles and mariah carey can not act save her soul and this could the only film her movie career dispite her terrific music career chris donnell not bad actor casper van dien but that not saying great deal seems held back and really doesn get into his character much and after even the first minutes gets annoying and old artie lange just seems like trying another chris farley and was completely unfunny and nerving why the filmmakers would want waste such cast such bad movie with such bad acting and dialogue question only they will know maybe they thought would become hit critical success and sometimes don agree with other critics movies even from the trailers for this film they made look bad and showed all the mildly funny parts its based the 1925 silent film seven chances which sure very better than this mess even though some may think this good date movie most who see this will want pull out thier hair and scream for thier money back besides being terrible movie the bachelor well terrible movie has nothing worth recommending therefore really can recommend this movie did not have good time and laughed only three times the running time the movie 106 minutes which wayyyy over time and needs shortened least thirty minutes parts seems forever and parts seem not last enough time being one the worst movies the year can sure that hope they will not make anymore stupid unfunny romantic comedies and they they give filmmakers

delightful heartwarming family film that sure entertain kids all ages even older ones who consider themselves too sophisticated for kiddie fare will surprised hear that this film for grown ups too there have been other movies this ilk boy and dog and while this one falls into that category mostly story about overcoming difficulties and finding good home for yourself move over rather roll over old yeller this dog flanders heartwarming delight the cinematography courtesy walther van den ende beautiful and really adds the powerful drama the film also gives feel being flanders the whole film was respectably shot flanders the music from richard friedman also remarkable evocative poignant score that recaptures music from the 19th century the opening song over the credits very beautiful hope

has happy ending though will not give away sorry strong and powerful enough for identify with the characters for the first time since the beginning 1999 there comes film which doesn rely popular

the right place and engages you you can guess where the film going because this well traveled territory but with pros like voight and appealing young performers like kissner often told story well worth revisit addition there were couple other enthusiasts such chicago sun times and the washington post you should read their reviews they really positive other critics however were not kind stephen holden the new york times had more than share beatings lay upon dog flanders via pen writing found the film sea sugary bromides and condemned voight character hopelessly wooden adopts accent even more indeterminate than the one came with for anaconda addition entertainment weekly slam dunked the film condemning the worst family film the year there have been many other bad reviews like this too suggestion disregard the critics they just have big problem with touching family films and one should never pay attention them this dog flanders may only little family movie probably won big hit the style titanic but then again other film has been since then but that not bad thing and itself this story that sure warm your heart and that what really matters about dog flanders also one the better family films around this year none the other films have seen this year though they were good have been low key and touching you looking for family style entertainment look further than this charming boy and dog yarn see while you still can for mentioned might not big bow wow the box office for long time see while you can there really need compare multi million dollar blockbuster such star wars

 |text mpaa not rated though feel would likely for martial arts violence with three movies already released theatrically america and least three more their way jackie chan one the newest hot properties action adventure stardom and just about time for over twenty five years jackie been starring martial arts and action movies hong kong thrilling audiences with both incredible grasp acrobatics and martial arts and wonderful sense comedy drunken master has the distinction being the first jackie chan movie make big this the movie that supposedly set jackie for big stardom hong kong not entirely sure why exactly many ways drunken master similar most jackie other early films such fearless hyena and master with cracked fingers half loaf kung spiritual kung and others fact looking all these early films together one gets the impression that they were stamped out cookie cutter style rate four six per year all using the same casts and telling very similar stories honest think that early jackie chan movies are something acquired taste they quite different from action movies know them america these films tend set the chinese countryside indeterminate period sometime the distant past with fairly slow plots that often meander far afield and sometimes seem exist only for the intention stringing comedy and fight scenes together drunken master though its plot tighter than some exception aside drunken master was the first jackie chan movie ever saw and saw the way was meant seen movie theater seattle part asian film festival the time didn really think was anything special but after having seen more films like kind grown drunken master storyline very similar that other early jackie chan movies such fearless hyena and and master with cracked fingers slacker martial arts student taught the martial arts harsh seeming master and has big fight with evil bad guy the end formula that has been adapted put kindly american films such karate kid more specifically jackie chan plays the part wong fei hong aka naughty panther fun loving practical joking kung student who too good kung for his own good but not _quite_ good enough after embarrassing his instructor assistant beating him roundly then beating bully marketplace wong fei hong tries hit pretty girl but discovers that she and her mother can hit back better than can and further chagrinned discover that the two women are his cousin and aunt respectively his father wong kei ying unhappy about this and further annoyed when the father and brother the bully show sue for damages kei ying soon institutes harsh regimen punishment which fei hong does not like all while escaping from this punishment fei hong meets with drunken old man who proceeds thrash him soundly then take him student and thrash him some more this turns out hua chi legendary master drunken style kung assigns fei hong series bizarre tasks such filling jugs with water while hanging upside down from frame cracking walnuts with his hands and other such exercises that seem like more pointless cruelty but are actually strengthening him then when ready teaches him the seven styles drunken kung unfortunately the lazy fei hong only practices six them drunken master features some wonderful martial arts sequences with jackie winning some fights and losing others been said before but say again these fights don just _happen_ they carefully choreographed any ballet performance and shows his fights jackie often makes use objects found his environment benches jugs cups bowls fruits and vegetables often new and surprising ways the fight scenes particularly those toward the end the film are unparallelled most american films whether jackie wins loses really something see and often funny anything too and funny the other thing jackie chan very very good there very little that new this movie jackie winning fights jackie getting beaten badly master jackie going through punishment training these schticks have all been seen before any one several dozen similar jackie movies from the seventies and early eighties but they still hilarious ever likewise jackie has _great_ supporting cast many whom were also other early jackie films and they often the source plenty hilarity their own the really big thing about drunken master though that inspired several copycats including couple starring jackie himself and sequel fifteen years later was the drunken style kung not certain whether not this actually genuine style kung but the principle behind imitate the wobbly movements drunkard lull the enemy into false sense security and apparently helps you drunk while you doing genuine not have admit there just something incredibly fun about watching fellow who looks utterly sloshed wading into group startled opponents and making mincemeat out them before they even realize what going come think perhaps this element what accounts for this film success over any the other jackie films not just martial arts the kind martial arts that makes you stop and whoa the negative side the cinematography this film nothing special the film stock rather primitive the plot often rather slow and the subtitles are sometimes extremely hard read against the background gone with the wind this isn still you like martial arts films like what you seen far jackie chan and want see more give shot much more real than chuck norris jean claude van damme you might very well like another interesting thing about drunken master has with its video availability the drunken master the only early jackie chan movie that know that you can find its original letterboxed hong kong subtitled form commercially available vhs from magnum video gold box for about there are plenty other early jackie films around but these are typically either dubbed pan and scanned form else import tapes priced for rental instead purchase thankfully drunken master least available the aspect ratio which was meant seen very affordable price you like drunken master take look the numerous other early jackie chan films that are out there even the dubbed ones aren really _too_ bad nothing else you can enjoy the martial arts choreography while making fun the dialogue particularly recommend spiritual kung half loaf kung the fearless hyena movies and snake crane arts shaolin also the mostly unrelated storywise sequel drunken master will hit theaters american release sometime later this year though what its american release title will still uncertain and comes _highly_ recommended this reviewer also for rather different interpretation the character wong fei hong who fact popular figure from chinese folklore been told suggest the once upon time china series starring jet though haven personally seen any them yet you choose watch drunken master really hope you enjoy and hope starts open your eyes the wonderful world asian cinema that out there all all give this film

 |text the opening shot midnight cowboy see close blank movie screen drive hear the soundtrack human cries and the stomping horses hooves without image projected onto the screen the audience unerringly identifies the familiar sound cowboys chasing indians and can spontaneously fill the blank screen with images old westerns our mind eye even without having seen cowboys and indians movie somehow the cliched images them seem have found their way into our mental schema but cowboys really exist are they merely hollywood images personified john wayne and gary cooper exploring this theme director john schlesinger uses the idea the cowboy metaphor for the american dream equally cliched yet ambiguous concept the ease which salvation and success can attained america hallmark its experience urban legend midnight cowboy suggests that the american dream like image the cowboy merely myth joe buck migrates from place place finds neither redemption nor reward his attempt create life for himself only further degeneration during the opening credits joe walks past abandoned theater whose decrepit marquee reads john wayne the alamo joe the bus listening radio talk show lady the air describes her ideal man gary cooper but dead troubled expression comes across joe face wonders where have all the cowboys gone having adopted the image cowboy since youth joe now finds himself deserted the persona tried embody joe persistence playing the act the cowboy serves analogue his american dream romanticizes about making the big city but his dreams will desert him forced compromise his ideals for sustenance the end midnight cowboy joe buck loses everything and gains nothing just the audience can picture cowboys chasing indians blank screen can also conjure scenes from pretty woman paradigms american redemption and success but how realistic are these ideals joe had raped and been raped texas the scars his troubled past prompt him migrate new york but does not know that his aspirations cowboy hero will fail him there just they had texas alongside the dream success the dream salvation the ability pack one belongings and start anew seems exclusive american convention schlesinger provides with strong hints joe abusive and abused past with flashbacks improper relationships with crazy anne and granny understand that joe adopts the ade cowboy symbol virility and gallantry attempt neutralize his shame runs from his past only sexually defiled this time his homosexual experiences new york the scene the diner which foreshadows joe encounter with the gay student joe buck spills ketchup himself standing see the ketchup has made red stain running from the crotch his pants down his thigh schlesinger visually depicts the degeneration joe virility eliciting image bleeding genitals signifying emasculation beyond the symbol castration the scene may also connote the bleeding virgin first sexual encounter reference joe first homosexual liaison the fact that the idea bleeding virgin relegated only females furthers the imagery joe emasculation ironic that joe has trouble prospecting for female clients but effortlessly attracts men joe believes his broncobuster getup emblematic his masculinity new yorkers see his ensemble camp and faggot stuff there are two predominant images new york the first that new york the rich cosmopolitan city where hope and opportunity are symbolized the tall skyscrapers and the statue liberty the other new york travis bickle new york seedy corruptive hell earth joe envisions new york the former but presented with the latter mirroring the irony which joe envisions his cowboy attire masculine mistakenly buys into the fable that new york filled with lonely women neglected gay men joe thinks performing great service for new york but the city rapes him his pride and possessions the people steal joe money the landlord confiscates his luggage and the homosexuals rob him his dignity what has become joe american dream schlesinger responds this question with the scene the party joe gets invited shindig sorts and the gathering exposed dizzying array food drugs and sex the party all joe and ratzo desires are made flesh joe flirts successfully with women and ratzo loads free salami contrasting joe daily struggles shots warhol crew display wanton indulgence there irreverence the partygoers attitude see shot woman kowtowing nothing particular orgies breaking out the periphery and drugs passed around like party favors the party makes mockery joe ideals joe believed that hard work and persistence were the elements for success america scenes the party and his rendezvous with shirley suggest that the idle who profit from joe toils the american dream schlesinger suggests merely proletarian fantasy for those who are content longer dream but become indolent joe heads miami all that was significant the cowboy image has left him his masculinity compromised and his morality relinquished for joe nothing left the cowboy hero and commensurately surrenders the identity tossing his boots into the garbage returns the bus for the last leg his journey miami the final shot midnight cowboy shows joe inside the bus more introspective taking only few glances outside the window instead the frequent pov shots joe excitedly looking out the bus his way new york schlesinger sets this final shot from the exterior the bus looking through the window joe reflections the palm trees ratzo raved about run across the bus window with joe hardly taking notice the scenery miami longer exacts the same excitement from joe before the world seems smaller joe now the termination his journey coincides with the termination his american dream longer does joe aspire the enterprising gigolo resolves return normal job and resign basic means midnight cowboy presents two familiar incarnations the american dream there the frontier fantasy that you are brave enough repel few indians you can set ranch out west and raise beautiful family then there the jay gatsby dream that man humble stock with perseverance can make fortune the big city joe attempt realize these dreams robs him his innocence texas and morality new

charles hendricks barry snider romero julia barr norma childs mpaa rating review the 1982 updating mickey spillane 1947 novel the jury hard boiled detective mike hammer vietnam vet who drives shiny bronze trans dresses like don johnson miami vice with less pastels and has sworn off alcohol however still smokes his lucky strikes detests all forms authority and kills whim beyond that the updated film retains little resemblance the original pulpy page turner spillane probably the most infamous and often reviled all mystery writers the movie starts off with bang howler opening credits sequence that cheap steal from the james bond series complete with cheesy graphics and overbearing jazz score bill conti rocky after that the movie and the book begin the same with the murder jack williams frederick downs one armed detective and hammer best friend hammer declares that will seek vengeance for jack death and with the help his devoted secretary the blond and shapely velda laurene landon and the alternately friendly antagonistic police chief pat chambers paul sorvino immediately the killer trail here the movie splits completely from the book and dives into convoluted and improbable tale government conspiracy and mind control tactics involving the mafia the cia one hammer vietnam vet buddies and kinky sex clinic many the same characters from the book appear the movie but they take slightly different roles for instance charles kalecki alan king numbers runner and narcotics dealer the book turns into suave mob boss and more importantly hammer suspicious love interest charlotte bennett barbara carrera morphs from run the mill psychiatrist into the coordinator and founder the sex clinic the jury one several cinematic renditions spillane books including 1953 version which was made but this film differs from those earlier versions one major way includes all the sex and violence spillane wrote about that could never given screen treatment due hollywood production code although this takes the 1982 version the jury closer the core the original subject matter this aspect that the film received the most criticism because took this new license extremes that many argued surpassed what was the book rest assured the movie not only includes great deal nudity but thoroughly violent especially toward women features one woman having her neck slashed set twins forced strip before being stabbed death psychotic sexual deviant programmed the cia judson scott and another woman shot point blank the belly hammer himself one would deny that spillane writing has definite misogynistic nature but the movie seems take step further giving such glorious screen treatment its constant equation sex and violence much which played with the intention being erotic quite unsettling surprise that the movie like the book fades black with dead woman the floor the jury had troubled production and was not well supported the studio that made which one explanation why didn well theaters and many people have forgotten that was ever made the script was written larry cohen who best known for his creatively cheesy but nonetheless effective monster movies like alive 1974 and its two sequels 1981 and the stuff 1985 cohen wrote the script thinking was going helm the project well but was yanked from the director chair after only week worth shooting because was already 100 000 over budget was quickly replaced richard heffron who has worked for the last three decades handful undistinguished movies and dozens television projects heffron was obviously brought not for his talent but because could make the movie rapidly and efficiently shows the final product cohen had personal interest the updated version hammer but heffron has none shot the movie quickly and clumsily and although some scenes ring true most them are flat trite and invariably dull the movie features numerous car chases shoot outs and stunts but heffron background television the dominant tone despite the graphic violence and full frontal nudity the jury takes the air made for quickie with real punch depth but the problems the jury run deeper than the technical the central fault this updating mike hammer whose character was lost the shuffle while updating from the fifties the eighties because spillane wrote all his hammer mysteries the first person hammer character central the tale because all the events are filtered through his persona never really get that impression the movie there first person voice over narration and some scenes don have hammer them all consequently great deal the texture spillane storytelling lost the period updating turns out detrimentally bad idea because much hammer moral code thrown the wind despite his characterization hard nosed violent misogynistic killer hammer always stuck fervently his own moral code the title itself the jury refers his anti establishment notion being his own law unlike private eyes who seek out the bad guys and then turn them over the police hammer both pursues the criminal and exacts the punishment this way can seen above the law but still adheres strictly her own personal code conduct his own morality the movie forgoes that aspect his character and hammer comes off not only amoral society terms but any terms especially his own anything hammer always had his professionalism but the movie does away with that the first three minutes showing him rolling the sack with the wife client who had paid him find out that wife was being unfaithful maybe the scene was intended for laughs but only cheapens hammer character and all accounts lousy way start the movie the blame for hammer character can laid assante shoulders because despite some unnecessary marlon brandon like mumbling delivers fine performance spillane never once described hammer physical attributes any the dozen books which appeared any actor could conceivably portray him course because the lack written description those who have read spillane books will have strong personal notion what hammer looks like and therefore almost any screen incarnation will somehow fall short expectations spillane who played the character himself 1963 the girl hunters generally considered the best the film hammers the rest actors are most noteworthy with the exceptions alan king and paul sorvino everyone who appeared the jury were and comers who basically went nowhere many them ended working television like carrera who had short stint dallas the mid eighties which only adds the made for atmosphere the film maybe someday someone will manage get the right elements together and make effective film rendition spillane book but this certainly not

 |text note some may consider portions the following text spoilers forewarned james toback return directing after eight year layoff two girls and guy film which comprised more less just that one guy blake robert downey two girls carla heather graham and lou natasha gregson wagner one primary setting blake absurdly spacious bachelor apartment and great deal dialogue embracing near real time approach this highly theatrical feature that completely hangs upon the performances its three actors and the quality the dialogue written toback for his bantering characters fortunately the film cast the challenge and the wordy exchanges between the triad characters while admittedly variable are occasionally wickedly amusing the film setup fairly generic nature and opens rather unpromisingly meet self possessed blonde carla and feisty brunette lou both waiting outside soho loft they engage idle chatter revealed that they both waiting for their respective boyfriends return from the airport and doesn take long for them come the realisation that they being two timed the same guy more indignant with him than catty with each other the duo break into blake loft and await his arrival for confrontation when blake returns his abode where the film hits its stride played with magnificent bombast downey blake cad all right but captivatingly dynamic blusterous and stealthy piece work that bursts onto the scene and raises the stakes new heights fascinating watch this character his natural habitat and perhaps the film best choice was have his two girlfriends scamper off into hiding upon his return allowing size blake not with his interactions with others but his own innate behaviour whether flamboyantly behind his piano rollicking rendition vivaldi the phone leaving messages his beloveds carla lou and his unseen sickly mother never less than wildly entertaining and insightful though this point almost hoped the film would transform into one man show typical afternoon the life blake you will carla and then lou reveal themselves and the sparks begin fly one the great touches the film how blake when startled carla unannounced appearance begins both verbally and physically backpedal even before realizes that the cat out the bag double teamed the understandably aggrieved women who are more smirkingly inquisitive than ferociously vengeful they want justification for his ongoing hypocrisy increasingly flustered blake weakly defends himself with apologetic and even self righteous declarations against their verbal jabs surprisingly delightful the waltz scathing witty banter shared its trio characters two girls and guy concludes its first sequence with unexpected apoplectic act such outrageous audacity that seemed nothing was off limits for this film however unfeasible attempt string along carla and lou outrage full feature length and the movie gradually transforms into the sharing exploratory profundities the nature fidelity and relationships that slowly but surely begins unravel the dialogue becomes less and less engaging and clever the film tempo loses its liveliness the dynamic between the characters evolves unconvincing fashion and several sequences fall flat subtle and not quite subtle allusions are made poster jules jim hangs prominently the wall and secrets are revealed which barrel the film toward uncompelling weepy finale one key turning point the film the kinky sex scene between blake and carla two girls and guy was embroiled bitter long running dispute with the mpaa with regards this scene contractually obligated deliver rated film toback was forced resubmit fourteen scaled down versions the steamy interlude before the mpaa withdrew their rating favour and while admittedly titillating the net effect the vignette the film thematic narrative rather dubious anything two girls and guy serves showcase for the phenomenal talents downey whose versatility put the test this film plays the gamut from indignant humbled from self assured disconcerted yet his acting gears shift smoothly not registered wonderful performance role custom tailored for him toback wrote the screenplay four days shortly after downey was arrested drug charges and hard not see echoes reality seeping into his character monologue his mirrored reflection blake self chiding get his shit together disquieting its resonance while downey showstopping performance undoubtedly the primary strength the film both actresses are solid more broadly observed roles graham quickly becoming one america more daring actresses involving herself three successive risky projects two girls and guy and boogie nights are both quite sexually frank while lost space has screenplay penned akiva goldsman she quite appealing here playing character once both dainty and sultry meanwhile gregson wagner initially portrays lou with such unwarranted spunk that audiences are likely find either annoying like endearing she tones down substantially the film progresses but found her more fun watch the artificially excitable chatterbox the film was reportedly shot eleven days filmed mostly sequence and the resultant artifacts this rapid shoot are evident throughout two girls and guy has agile spontaneous sort feel and one senses that toback encouraged good deal improvisation from his three actors while the film could transposed directly the stage more less intact doesn feel constricted the expansive apartment setting well used vary the background and toback allows his camera wander and linger his characters effective manner two girls and guy falls short its potential but thanks some stellar work downey still often enjoyable bitingly funny romp particularly watch the surprisingly resilient blake evasively try rationalize his behaviour and even turn the tables his girlfriends actor tells them one point using the tried and tested occupational hazard defense actors lie but not they all seem agree denzel washington

 |text much ballyhoo has been made over this new version lolita made time when one would think that faithful adaptation the infamous novel could made over its use pedophilia and such important address straight forwardly before any other ideals such goodness and themes can discussed this film has been film limbo for number years lying around vaults san distributor and having critics waiting either hail masterpiece call anticlimactic horseshit when seeing this film after all the hoopla keeping mind that there are people namely who are fans the novel who have been eagerly awaiting this flick since its creation well you just have wonder why one really picked for distribution what even worse that seeing this lolita especially the first time and you familiar with anything lolita admittingly very anticlimactic this real pity because when you really sit down watch this film ignoring all the crap that has preceeded really quite film perhaps the best film director adrian lyne although really look its competition flashdance fatal attraction and indecent proposal least besides jacob ladder seen this lolita twice the first time wasn blown away seemed overly dramatic and surprisingly unaffecting the second time not really thinking about how waited for what seems like forever see and how seeing set premium cable channel and not giant movie theatre really affected emotionally the story itself surprisingly heartbreaking one which why such good novel and why this such good film the story pedophile obsessed with young year old girl named dolores lolita great because not trash for the perverted but because about human obsession with things that are out one reach its protagonist the comically named humbert humbert not your average pedophile but seriously wounded human being who embodies how are all destroyed our sick obsessions and idosyncrasies the character lolita almost symbol the forbidden apple christian mythology something that will destroy but that can live without these ideas are all worked into this film nicely but done way that not heavy handed all but instead lyrical and emotionally devastating the focus this film and the reason for making seems was really penetrate the emotional depths the novel and bring them life the screen beautifully dramatic images and scenes which are blatantly over stylized the tone the book comical one but also tragic one and humbert telling the story from his perspective blows every single thing out perspective humbert exists fantsy world his obsessions and desires and this reflects the way the entire film has been designed get sense that perhaps doing this that humbert has really trapped himself into fate that will ultimately leave him haggard and destroyed weeps uncontrollably and never lets himself get over his original year old love and allows himself embody her lolita lets his feelings for her navigate all his decisions and the end has nothing but overly dramatic feelings for her the story recognizes the extreme this almost out test seeing the readers will really sympathize with someone who socially deemed pervert and one almost wonders while reading the book the author vladimir nabokov wrote the book means bring into focus his own sick obsessions and perhaps bring them peace the weirdest thing about this film that the end when humbert has reached the finale his obsessional journey can easily sympathize and even identify with him the opening and final images the film are the same and who hasn done similar action that wandering about without any sense reality anything else but deep sadness this the second time the novel has been adapted for the screen the first time being filmed shock 1962 stanley kubrick who couldn possibly have brought the novel the screen with much faithfulness lyne has been able but did the next best thing economized for everything and came with droll black comedy about obsession general that film used the traps society benefits the studio demanded the final scene that heinous murder come first the film portray humbert first murderer and second pedophile and when you see gives the film depth man trapped obsession the censors wouldn allow anymore than couple glances and subtle dialogue show the relationship between humbert and lolita kubrick decided play comedy but still allow the tragedy seep through looking these two versions especially after reading the novel and all know that when read novel and see film adaptation are bound angered any size differences really impossible compare them they both for different things and one has lot more room sexually frank the novel was and although true that several scenes are similar and are thus for comparison overall unfair say which one better and which one worse have never been one for saying the level greatness film adaptation novel deemed how faithful and won say that here however this film pretty amazing mostly because hey loved the book and this film nearly reminded doesn have nearly much wit couple comical scenes and even lot good chuckles but just not totally witty but does have the same emotional toll that the novel had some that the casting the two leads jeremy irons with his deep soft british voice and gentle look amazing humbert droll very unique way and well one can look distraught the way does brings wonderful sympathy the role that goes beyond pathos and really comes being easy identify with the audience and when looks lolita with love and she looks him with lust you know that her prisoner for long lives and dominique swain who plays the title character rather incredible she pulls off the tough role even better than sue lyon did the original wonderfully balancing the qualities seduction bratiness and self centeredness that marks the character easy see why she surrenders humbert she loves the attention and knows that she can have her way with him any time when denies her something she blackmails him effortlessly scene involving rocking chair and little foot action damn near classic and when stands her she weeps and runs away leaving humbert follow her there are two other minor characters the film one who road block the beginning and the other who reappearing threat the relationship the former charlotte lolita mother played melanie griffith the book charlotte monster woman overbearing constantly scolding her child overly religious and ultimately selfish and she the one obstacle humbert has overcome obtain his goal least the beginning played shelly winters the original she represented all these qualities played griffith here she about half them annoying watch film and play game where you try see who could have done the role way better than the one screen without mentioning the actor who played them first and even though griffith not really bad persay she nothing more the other clare quilty the writer who also trying seduce lolita and succeeds but price langella takes totally different direction than the one peter sellars took the original quilty was comic character the original threat the form many forms popping states rambling german proning and eventually drunk langella takes the other route allowing all the creepiness unearthed and the result character who exists shadows and low shots and who meets wonderfully ironic ending the exact opposite what thought him you can see most these are not improvements mistakes done the part lyne and his screenwriter stephen schiff but just parts whole new look the novel least cinema wise this version beautiful and perpetually saddening the camera movements are stylized and each shot breathtakingly rich the acting for the most part wonderful and when watch really get sense that for humbert who telling the story the only two people earth most the time were

 |text countries and legal systems that take the rule law principle seriously had forbidden judges and juries make judgements all matters that could involve them personally luckily movie reviewers aren burdened with such legislation otherwise small pool very special movies would forever ignored this reviewer case star wars 1977 science fiction epic george lucas the consequences would even more severe because that film very special for tens millions not hundreds millions fans any case objectivity something seldom seen star wars reviews because undisputed majority reviewers rate one the best not the best film all times those who don usually have some difficulties hiding their artistic snobbery the author this review must also concede his inability use cold objective standards reviewing this film like many previous reviewers must note that watched star wars for the first time twenty years ago and that remained enchanted the experience ever since perhaps was childlike fascination with until then unimaginable wonders that happened long time ago galaxy far away perhaps was the rush felt minutes before the opening shots with expectations already pumped serialised comic books and novelisation had read before anyway watching star wars was one the most important movie going experiences life and was also unmatched for many years come because very few movies managed have such strong impact like george lucas epic star wars wasn just important movie for the millions fans who probably share the same sentiment was the defining moment the history modern cinema until than american motion picture industry was limbo social turmoil 1960s practically destroyed the old hollywood and new authors filled the void mostly using hollywood financial and technical resources create serious personal artsy movies result audience traumatised dark reality vietnam and watergate didn want see the same dark and serious content the silver screen george lucas with its science fiction epic was among the first come into rescue the audience responded with unprecedented enthusiasm and huge financial success the movie later backed supplement industry toys books comics role playing games and other merchandise slowly began change the face hollywood serious adult movies with artistic ambitions faded into oblivion and were replaced industrial products blockbuster philosophy one the biggest casualties that trend was the science fiction movie genre until 1977 science fiction movies were mostly production domain late 1960s bigger budgets for science fiction didn look strange anymore thanks the great success 2001 space odyssey but the same success coincided with the surge pesimism and hollywood science fiction was bleak the rest its production mostly dark dystopic movies however 1977 star wars showed once and for all that this genre can inspiration for popular movies even among the audience that usually doesn like result seriousness cinematic science fiction began fading away although some good dark and cult quality and continued filmed until early 1980s after that science fiction continued considered synonym for family entertainment ironically the man responsible for star wars was its time considered member new hollywood generation young movie authors who made artsy and personal films early 1970s george lucas established himself with the dystopic movie thx 1138 and nostalgic drama american graffiti both movies were considered personal its time despite latter one becoming very popular sense star wars also very personal film and the thorny way the final production shows that commercial considerations were against not for but unlike many personal movies the era its personality was line with the wishes the general audience the plot set long time ago galaxy far away begins time civil war the evil empire threatened rebels who want restore the old republic order quash any opposition the empire had built death star superweapon powerful

they hire the spaceship owned rogue pilot han solo harrison ford and his furry sidekick chewbacca peter mayhew critics who don like the movie especially those who can forgive lucas for his contribution the quashing new hollywood are prone point the lack originality the surface they might right lucas himself admits that found lot inspiration the lore old hollywood westerns wwii aviation

the movie death would say that the inspiration for star wars went even further into collective subconscious western civilisation hinted some mild tolkien references the others would find the author element within the story star wars could seen anti establishment film young long haired easy going nature loving heroes are fighting against old uptight and oppressive forces who use supertechnology most demonic purposes even out its historical social context star wars impressive strictly technical piece the seven art george lucas direction very good with the clever editing and well paced segments between action and dramatic buildup characters are well drawn and deliver all the necessary ingredients both for the space opera and hollywood blockbuster have coming age hero damsel distress somewhat toned down due the popular feminist trends the time reluctant helper benevolent mentor diabolical villain and finally comic relief form two non human characters some the actors are very good alec guiness his most famous role date james earl jones whose voice enough cause unease peter cushing incarnation pure evil human form unfortunately the same can said for the main leads among the main trio mark hamill carrie fisher and harrison ford only the last one had the character three dimensional enough launch his further acting career the thing that looked like the most important segment star wars phenomena during its initial release was the new level special effects technology often comparisons with 2001 space odyssey another ground breaking film were citing the sheer number effects proof the lucas superiority over kubrick however the special effects john dykstra and john stears are indeed impressive even after two decades although 1997 special edition did improve them significantly yet they aren the most remembered trademark the movie that honour should definitely the oscar winning soundtrack john williams whose work star wars probably the brightest gem his brilliant career newer generations viewers might somewhat deprived the enchantment that still holds those lucky enough witness star wars original release yet even they are immune the george lucas magic they should watch this film nevertheless perhaps only become familiar with something that essential part contemporary culture

that which surrounds him except his craft and the music which his craft responsible for producing even the relationship between and his boss maxime andre dussollier controlled and almost manipulated association highlighted the fact that stephane permits maxime win close squash matches the beginning the movie stephane closed solitary individual and the audience carefully left wonder about the depth emotion behind this enigmatic man camille kessler emmanuelle beart master violinist and the new love maximes maxime much love with camille that plans and does leave his wife like stephane camille outwardly very controlled and reserved sacrificing all thought and emotion her violin and the music which emerges when stephane and camille meet there recognition bonding both individuals however whereas camille submits the wild interplay emotions which she now feels for stephane stephane only admits that camille attracted him stephane ignores his feelings for camille which the audience cannot help but see present the movie progresses the two characters become more and more polarized their views and emotions for one another these two people with very similar approaches life initially react their new circumstance very differently stephane becomes even more rational and controlled while camille becomes more tempestuous until she almost borders suffering nervous breakdown due the inability consummate their relationship however their approach each other perhaps not surprising considering their vocation the audience led believe that stephane may have been genius violinist well due his relationship with master violin teacher however apparently could not violinist due his intolerance for flaws his playing consequently stephane becomes precision craftsmen with

credit that manages maintain this uncertainty this movie not about judging stephane actions being right wrong but about viewing their growth and accepting the characters who they are find the ending appropriate unfortunately found the last ten minutes which led the final scene very unfulfilling this portion the film where the sense closure could have been successfully accomplished unfortunately there hurried and almost soap opera type surge emotions from all the characters while ravel may not quite accomplished schubert mozart ravel has his day this film the synergism the tension ravel music and tension the screen the best have ever seen the directing this movie wonderful the actors and actresses are excellent each playing their part with great sincerity and warmth emmanuelle beart personality beautiful and needless say must say that emmanuelle beart herself beautiful besides the near ending the only other criticism the movie which have that the movie almost too cerebral almost left with the sense little happened because almost all the changes which occur the movie happen deep their psyches and little their personalities the situations which they end part the one question which left with while they have accepted their lot has their attitude towards love changed have several possibilities which believe the movie hints but unsure which the director espousing summary this movie solely about the character growth two characters who almost develop relationship the process see their attitude towards life and other people itself not believe coeur complicated movie where does become complicated when juxtapose the scenes the movie into the greater walk life where americans have preconceived american notions relationship love and people wonder how the movie translates when viewed within its native french culture however bringing american preconceptions enjoyed the film would welcome any comments about this movie from any who have seen

 |text seeing the outrageous previews for bulworth one wonders what plot could possibly allow beatty get away with making those statements case you missed warren beatty plays politician the campaign trail says black congregation you can cut down malt liquor and chicken wings and get behind someone other than running back who stabs his wife you never gonna get rid well there such plot and works very well this comedy beatty plays jay billington bulworth long time democratic senator from california the movie opens painfully repetitious montage bulworth latest commercials condemning affirmative action the montage ironically intercut with pictures martin luther king and bulworth his youth working with jack kennedy when finally lay eyes bulworth morosely weeping front his having gone without food sleep for days his campaign entering the final weekend before the primaries but his depression has sunk too far for him care first calls lobbyist from the insurance industry get bribe million life insurance policy his daughter name then calls associate arrange for his own assassination his assistant murphy oliver platt oblivious bulworth suicidal state and drags him his speaking engagements bulworth halfheartedly reads his speech african american church then takes questions from the audience hit hard with questions about his voting record had promised money help rebuild the community after the riots and hasn shown since dead man anyway figures answer truthfully and bill clinton and newt gingrich came for the photo opportunity they made some promises that improved their public image for while and then counted the media and the public eventually forget about the promises they made the shock and outrage from the congregation grows the questions keep coming and keeps shooting back honest ugly answers before further like make distinction that the denver post failed make and that that characterizing african americans malt liquor drinking fans not part bulworth truth that line the trailers but should not praised like the other political confessions makes the movie when the critics praise beatty for speaking the truth about politics this line not what they talking about the experience liberating with nothing left lose bulworth longer restricted burping generic platitudes out both sides his mouth can say whatever wants because going dead anyway why not tell the people the truth about being sleazy politician that bought and paid for lobbyists and that racism among the populace protects politicians from being the target charges classism bulworth candor wins him three volunteers from the church one whom nikki halle barry gets crush feels good afterwards that actually eats something chicken wings appropriately enough bulworth shows late for his meeting with some movie studio executives when one them asks where stands government regulation movie and ratings bulworth drifts the topic the quality filmed entertainment with much money and many talented people working hard wonders why can hollywood make quality product you warren when they become indignant and ask why talking them has such low opinion their product callously admits that because they are rich jews that night drops the three african american volunteers their nightclub and decides with them stays all night drinking smoking pot dancing falling love with nikki and learning scratch turntables and rap the next day shuns his prepared speech and instead raps the suit and tie fundraisers from then all his political appearances raps his political truth his rap not bad for middle aged white guy not very good but his first try and least not embarrassingly bad his lobbyists are not amused but the rest his constituency seems like the new bulworth eventually the movie plot remember hired hit man overtakes the politics which too bad screen time spent with bulworth trying cancel the request for his assassination while the hit man seems closing him there are even few gratuitous chase scenes bulworth fleeing his killer these scenes may have been necessary keep the events the film moving along but distracted and detracted from bulworth political ranting which was much more interesting than the ever present obvious looking assassin still most the movie original and very enjoyable and beatty deserves most credit for bringing the screen the story and screen writer came first with good structure then with good dialogue back jeremy pikser wrote the screenplay actor was able convincingly portray bulworth depression then liberation and rebirth producer there were four others was able keep the movie free from hollywood indulgent formulas except for those inexcusable chase scenes someone else probably could have directed but since was there anyway what the heck too bad that there aren more movies like this around movies that tackle political corruption way that challenges viewers pay more attention real politics after all much the inspiration for bulworth straight out the news just little perception and insight and you could write your own bulworth rants just don expect popular with the insurance companies

 |text not quite sure what say about mars attacks which obviously the work deranged genius when tim burton twisted alien invasion comedy really works breathtaking and hilarious equal measure and when doesn work just dull not even sure works more often than doesn but where counts that when this gleefully evil invading force from the red planet gets down the business blasting kingdom come mars attacks brilliant mars attacks based rather unsavory series trading cards released topps the 1950s and takes its cues from the same sources this summer independence day old alien invasion flicks disaster movies and big budget special effects extravaganzas but unlike independence day which was painfully middle the road appeal the hearts minds and wallets america mars attacks has fully developed and very personal sense wonder about the big difference that while independence day celebrated the resilience human beings mars attacks portrays the greedy and hapless schmucks that are the title sequence just splendid incredible swarm flying saucers rises out the canals the red planet and then storms earthward through the solar system formation the spinning metal saucers are dead ringers for the invading forces movies past and their first appearance the big screen combination with danny elfman thundering theremin driven score absolutely jaw dropping overwhelming that swear you had trouble breathing the movie lays low for the next minutes get glimpse the alien leader resplendent purple sequined cape when television message broadcast the people the world naturally the only way communicate with earthlings preempt our regularly scheduled programming but mostly the first act spent developing characters setting mildly comic situations and drawing quirky but dishearteningly drab picture america according tim burton good thing that the most compelling personality the movie belongs the aliens because burton just not interested making more than caricatures out his human stars anyone who comes mars attacks expecting see lot one favorite actor bound disappointed with few exceptions these characters are dispatched the film progresses jack nicholson lot fun the president the united states but fizzles sleazy las vegas hotel developer rod steiger does amusing enough take strangelove buck turgidson glenn close brings some star power the role the first lady and martin

egg eyes with red pupils darting this way and that these animated invaders are malevolence incarnate joe dante gremlins are the closest equivalent recent memory but burton little monsters are more inventive the film raison etre are the scenes crimes against mankind the most famous monuments the world crumble under the alien assault easter island turned into bowling alley and the nasty little buggers perform hideous medical experiments captured humans the sheer level mayhem staggering especially when the aliens make their first attack blasting human beings into iridescent skeletons parents are urged pay special attention the rating earned the special effects vary from charming astonishing deliciously cheesy and least couple shots mass destruction seem have been engineered specifically response independence day although mars attacks was production long before that film release cinematographer peter suschitzky who makes the most wynn thomas wildly imaginative production design thomas helped define the spike lee style actually took time off from his mars attacks regimen shoot crash for david cronenberg cronenberg movie will almost certainly more somber won released the until early next year but mars attacks surely similarly elegant nightmare this not nice movie and which studio executive was duped into giving burton million make setting the film final scenes the nearly empty holocaust ravaged america that independence day conveniently avoided burton invasion epic suggests that the world got may not worth saving until many the people are dead the victims his invasion are naive greedy disastrously self absorbed and good thing too since the movie wicked charm dependent our ability take this invasion partly wish fulfillment fantasy the surviving cast members are the innocents and the entertainers who triumph determining that the alien invaders the ultimate elitists are actually susceptible the kitschiest strains american pop culture ultimately this messy

 |text remember back the mid 1990s when crime and macabre movies were all the rage pulp fiction and fargo both managed get oscar nominations for the best picture and not surprisingly slew rip offs followed the years thereafter that fad seems over but here comes christopher mcquarrie writing and directing the way the gun that first glance looks like another those wanna but upon closer inspection doesn look like anything comprehendable crime story wrapped its own little world has claustrophobic atmosphere film that won allow the story much room expand outside its handful characters and somehow still manages turn simple premise into something complex its ridiculous complexity should come surprise anyone who familiar with mcquarrie wrote the usual suspects which has become cult favorite despite little critical acclaim that film had great story and was well directed but had such elaborate confusing screenplay leaves many viewers scratching their heads after repeated viewings you have wonder mcquarrie really had everything mapped out was going for the hollywood idea that really confusing and about criminals and cops that makes fascinating with the way the gun mcquarrie seems capitalizing the same idea but this time the story far less commercial shame because maybe that would have helped the film tells the story two drifters with ambition and barely reason live but aren hell bent death either played ryan phillipie and benecio del toro they get lucky when they hear about scheme between big shot exec guy and his trophy wife who are going have baby through vitro fertilization they figure they can kidnap the surrogate mother played juliette lewis and get nice ransom along the way continually learn the shady dealings between the exec his wife their hired goons and the bag man played james caan the only actor the film who looks like knows what doing the exec some kind money launderer obviously can call the authorities for help his goons and the bag man are the kidnappers trail and each make different offers get the mother back the exec son doctor who also gets pulled into the fray and wants make sure his patient all right meanwhile each these characters has something hidden their collective sleeves and the double crosses secret love affairs and torrid pasts come surprise even though little has any relevance all mcquarrie doesn know the meaning the word simple seems more interested showing how clever than making good movie everything has complicated and confusing much that the point surrealism nothing what seems this reality one those movies where you get dropped right into the middle the criminal world and are expected know most the industry rules and regulations every scene with caan character exemplifies this perfectly the kidnappers already know who and even chat with him getting into conversations about the business and how works and hardly given clue what they talking about these characters are probably supposed great criminal sketches but they more like ideas ripped off from sketches found david mamet trash one here really acts like real person and the story even further removed from reality like dream without any appeal take the opening scene for example the phillipe and del toro characters are parking lot across the street from bar club counting their money and stuff they sit brand new mercedes and the car alarm goes off the owner waiting line and yells them get away from his car but they don move the guy and his loud mouth potty mouth girlfriend and about other people cross the street and gang them you think phillipe and del toro are going pull out guns and scare them away but they don instead phillipe throws one punch and the two get beat down mob there lot things didn understand about this scene first all the owner the mercedes isn some yuppie old rich snob like hippie straight out the 60s secondly the two main characters seem believe that they can actually take the mob unarmed lastly serves purpose the long run because later the film the two are packing more artillery than small country army they were suicidal they wouldn have gone the kidnapping job the first place and where they get all those guns never explained either there lot more could pick apart about this film but that would exercise futility what all comes down that nothing here what seems which would great this movie were about pretty much any other story than what absolutely none the characters are likable believable and all coated with thin layer black comedy which good for chuckle here and there but this film definitely not flat out black comedy and its use such seems like desperate attempt kill screen time with any film you see whether you like not you can least understand what the appeal was why someone would want make and why someone would want see can say either for the way the gun because has very little going for and can imagine anyone intelligently defending

 |text cinema has been around for about hundred years now not job recap this century every time talk about new film but like think that beginning understand the art more watch more films from before time recently seen the films hitchcock capra fellini godard kurosawa chaplin lang and many others those men were talented artists and their films reflect their genius they are likely remembered for well quite while like this film too yes disaster slash action movie true its budget lot more money than ever see lifetime and there not doubt mind that the only reason was conceived was make lot money fact bet the producers armageddon would have worked towards lousy film had they thought would been more profitable certainly don care what their intentions were because michael bay the rock such skilled director that doubt ever make film that difficult sit through course skillful direction doesn complete the package but the rest armageddon manages keep everything together the story well thought out and perfectly paced provide for abundance action sequences that never feel out place the acting terrific the script sharp and get this there are characters yes you read that right armageddon actually has characters you can care about you don like this film then you have problem with the genre itself armageddon good film like this can you seen deep impact then you know the basic framework for the story turns out that asteroid the size texas going strike the earth eighteen days from the start the film the government stop why the always exclusively saddled with these problems never fully investigated their plan send group experienced oil drillers the asteroid drill down several hundred feet and detonate nuclear warhead within the head driller harry stamper bruce willis his group men colorful bunch including ben affleck chick will patton and rockhound steve buscemi there also interesting triangle formed between harry and grace liv tyler who harry daughter and grace are course romantically intertwined and dad isn too happy with the situation absurd wish for complicated story event movie special effects movie whatever you like call armageddon not about story about viscera and action and thrills minute and all that stuff incidental really that the story cohesive and even remotely believable because most people will too wrapped the explosions give two seconds thought what actually happens but bay the one congratulate this case for has made film entertaining and visually sharp that doubt any director could have done better think most the budget went cameras alone because bay films every action sequence from about thirty forty different angles take the spectacular opening scene for instance which meteor shower obliterates new york meteor flies out the sky and crashes into building which sends fireballs erupting into the air and cars spinning like tops upon other cars the action itself might take five seconds real life but bay edits quickly that get the same scene six different ways like his quick edit style because abrasive and exhausting watch also very loud and obnoxiously noisy times but fun obnoxious sometimes the special effects this film put every other 1998 blockbuster shame deep impact visually has absolutely nothing armageddon and offer comparison between the quality this film and godzilla simply laughable special effects are very important film like this they not good then the image not convincing and the film doesn work everything here looks bright and explosive from the little meteors bursting through skyscrapers all the way the shots the earth through the jutting rocks the ominously approaching asteroid the effects that don look totally real are still pleasure behold and credit everyone involved for creating the first blockbuster nice looking that actually qualifies art course all this would add little more than above average light show didn get the feeling that bay cares much about his characters does about his action the film two and half hours long and not all that spent submerged numbing action much the film dedicated developing the various characters subplots won suggest that these are complex characters but their problems are real and the emotions aren put forth sentimental and overbearing way fact there are three four scenes here that had pretty choked and that lot more than can say about deep impact which was banking the feel good parts its story bruce willis terrific and glad see him bigger than life again recent turns films like mercury rising have been very disappointing tyler and affleck are great together and make convincing couple all the scenes between them work comfortable level patton who magnificent actor thankfully not wasted here and the minor subplot revolving around his wife and son very moving the comic relief from buscemi and peter stormare who plays crazy russian astronaut nifty and keeps the film lively and funny wasn challenged think real hard while watching armageddon and don mind too much but the film doesn insult intelligence pitched perfectly entertain which what all really wants not mindless and escapist but well crafted cinema might have been

 |text note some may consider portions the following text spoilers forewarned december 1996 amidst all the year end oscar bait releases from the major studios miramax genre label dimension films quietly released sly little ensemble slasher flick titled scream although the teen horror market had been given for all but dead recent years the film shocked industry observers scoring consistently high box office returns eventually topping 100 million domestic and becoming one the most successful films its type history while delighting audiences finally presenting set knowing slasher flick protagonists who were aware the all the standard cliches associated with the genre the sleeper success scream sent shockwaves through the industry suddenly everybody was looking for hip inexpensive fright films that might able reap similar fortunes the strategy casting young stars draw the youth demographic was given boost scream director wes craven previously best known the creator new line nightmare elm street film series was thrust back into the limelight and scream rookie scribe kevin williamson burst onto the film scene stunning fashion hard understate this last point williamson has based upon his produced screenplays this writing scream know what you did last summer from october 1997 and now scream enjoyed meteoric rise fame quickly become the most well known screenwriter amongst the entertainment weekly reading box office figure watching youth culture since well since that quentin tarantino guy whom said has also achieved some renown director indeed singularly freakish oddity the screenwriter williamson and not the director that has been receiving the lion share acclaim for the success scream and the print advertisements for scream theatrical release are similarly indicative his increasing prominence while the traditional film wes craven drapes the film title the ads right below equal sized font yet reads written kevin williamson affirmation the screenwriter contribution the project which may unprecedented can envision the board wga licking their chops this coup and counting the days until their goal film attained and much like tarantino screenwriting williamson work vaguely unconventional incorporating both contemporary pop culture references and allusions other films into the dialogue his characters scream they satirically discussed other horror films here the sequel the characters discuss the relative merits film sequels scream was written 1995 during the infamous bob dole rampage against hollywood and williamson rejection this tirade clearly influenced the writing both that film and this sequel while the sequel was planned from the outset treatment scream was included when williamson sold the screenplay for scream the basic premise for the film and the reunion the surviving characters nevertheless seems extremely artificially contrived and only about the film midway point when becomes engaging like its predecessor scream opens with splashy eye grabbing prologue which only vaguely ties into the film principal narrative this time around following the exploits young couple jada pinkett and omar epps attending riotously gleeful sneak preview screening stab running film within film gag where the true life events behind the first film has been turned into movie however although tries hard and has some good ideas the nightmarishly enthusiastic audience the film vaguely reminded the one was sharing the theatre with and was certainly thinking about gutting the overly noisy person few seats away myself after about fifteen minutes the prologue pale imitation the bravura opening sequence the original with drew barrymore where her performance not only convinced that she could act but was good that would rank among the best performances horror film that ever seen there are too many knowing hip pop culture references crammed into the scream sequence and the setup isn nearly cleverly frightening scream while the first film preface dizzyingly built final shot that was exhilaratingly terrifying the payoff here almost campily theatrical flash the campus smalltown ohio college where returning characters sidney neve campbell and randy jamie kennedy have relocated for their studies and escape the notoriety from the events the first film the murders which open this film result reuniting the survivors single minded tabloid reporter gale weathers courteney cox roars into town cover the breaking story while ever awkward former deputy dewey riley david arquette flies protectively guard over sidney they joined cotton weary liev schreiber who was falsely accused homicide cameo appearance during the first film his role here significantly expanded the film incidentally provides surprisingly little backstory although suppose good case can made that really isn necessary not because many people have seen the first installment but because this after all sequel slasher film what you think happened these characters the prior movie there lot new faces the scene too sidney new boyfriend derek jerry connell and her new roommate hallie elise neal randy fellow film student mickey timothy olyphant gale newly assigned nervous cameraman joel duane martin omnipresent local journalist debbie salt laurie metcalf cici cooper buffy herself sarah michelle gellar and pair simpering sorority sisters rebecca gayheart and sirens portia rossi any these characters could the killer for that matter could the next victim seemingly becoming regular staple kevin williamson screenplay the narrative once again framed around the increasingly flimsy premise whodunit one problem that scream didn have was keeping you interested the identity the killer here and some extent know what you did last summer williamson screenplay seems slightly hampered trying turn the identity the killer into mystery the film occasionally becomes bogged down with misdirection that you can sense straining the seams try and drop red herrings left and right the expense its thriller elements doesn help matters any that the killer alter ego fairly obvious from the get indeed the finale plays full out camp when the villain finally unmasked frothing the mouth with glazed eyes this one those cases where the villain goes such endless diatribe about their machinations scheming and motivation that you actually get bored listening and just want them all get with while the basic setup and premise for the film fairly contrived the aspect where head and shoulders above its predecessor its suspense sequences they staged much more imaginatively here save for the first post prologue murder which handled such mediocre conventional fashion that seems culled directly from the predictable 1980s slasher flicks that the first film satirized and are much more fun watch hard hold back smile during giddy scene where sidney and her companion have climb over the incapacitated killer order escape from car wreck and cat and mouse chase involving gale and dewey campus sound lab very nicely staged although its ultimate resolution hilariously overblown terms its characters the strong part the film the interesting relationship between gale and dewey who ambles onto the screen accompanied his very own theme music their verbal sparring the outset provides much humour exchange where dewey defensively rebukes charges perceived aura incompetency well written and there curiously endearing aspect about their relationship amidst all the mayhem and bloodshed the other hand sidney pretty dull here she doesn have any compelling presence and there nothing particularly interesting about her this time around make care about her other than that she the returning heroine given this and the fact that there strong second banana character for sidney elise neal role isn nearly substantive enough adequately fill rose mcgowan shoes wonder why the roles for gale and dewey have been significantly augmented for this installment the film what surprises the most about scream its zealousness decimating its cast the film mounting body count bears out the fact that character safe well almost while principal applaud this bold policy some point you got wondering about just how many characters will make the next sequel was particularly surprised with the untimely demise one particular whose casting for the next installment the series would seemed obvious but hey rose mcgowan character said the first film please don kill ghostface want the sequel look what that got her

hell army donning necroplasmic costume replete with knives chains and morphing cape sullen wise cogliostro and flatulating wisecracking violator for spawn attention comments when todd mcfarlane left marvel comics where had made name for himself first rate comic book penciller the spider man titles join the newly formed creator owned image comics new comic book legend was born spawn mcfarlane spawn immediately became commercial and critical success and defining comic book series the 1990s mcfarlane created hero who was not only original but visually intricate allowing mcfarlane utilize his knack for artistic detail the max the early spawn issues brilliantly capture mcfarlane genius illustration and show his early attempts writing with the popularity spawn and the success the current warner bros batman film franchise movie version some sort seemed inevitable for spawn the summer 1997 hence new line cinema released spawn live action film based the groundbreaking series this topheavy exercise violence and special effects unfortunately topples quickly and leaves fans the comic book like numbed how much spawn misses the mark what happened why spawn bad todd mcfarlane himself executive produced this disappointing misfire and even appears cameo don think however that his presence necessarily hurt helped the film place the blame part the recent hollywood trend fueled public demand apparently for special effects blow out movies utilizing the latest computer technology these films focus upon the effects the expense everything else character plot dialogue etc spawn reflecting this trend shows the audience one gratuitous scene after another populated with morphing characters and filled with unnecessary pyrotechnics hardly minute goes this film without fires explosions knives and chains appearing out nowhere glowing eyes constantly transforming demons lot visually interesting and technically solid don get wrong but because the script and cast aren engaging spawn ultimately comes across like overwrought wallpaper the surface may capture the eye but nothing exists underneath spawn translation the comic book suffers the most the storyline level mcfarlane spawn was tortured hero mercenary trade simmons was nonetheless warm man love with the beautiful wanda having died and journeyed hell made pact return earth with wanda simmons however discovers that his memories are fragmented his body creepy mess and his wife married despite his sometimes violent nature readers couldn help but feel sympathetic toward his plight the spawn the underworld spawn attempts show all this but does not spend nearly the time should when the characters are developed they seem absurd rather than touching the cartoonish dialogue and implausible subplot general possesses the antidote supervirus called heat which wishes unleash enslave the world not help matters spawn apparent attempt duplicate the success batman also unwisely spends too much time villain the violator batman favored the joker over batman john leguizamo like jack nicholson batman receives top billing the cast the violator michael jai white simmons spawn second ordinarily find leguizamo intensely annoying presence films which seems make him perfect candidate for the violator the film however spends much time the violator offensive antics that they grate the nerves apparently meant the comic relief the film nicholson was batman especially when contrasted with the sullen spawn the violator lines are oftentimes grotesque and unfunny leaving the audience wishing would leave leguizamo does satisfactory job the role but seen far too often the film michael jai white relative newcomer theatrical releases seems appealing actor and handles his role adequately but see little him without various masks more time needed spent white character before became spawn for the movie pull the heartstrings special note should made about martin sheen the over the top obnoxious evil general wynn easily the hammiest performance the movie hard imagine how sheen mucked his role much after all played vietnam assasin brilliantly the great apocalypse now sheen excessive demeanor not help the audience accept him mastermind villain and comes surprise considering his extensive career film many other elements conspire with the disappointing script and abundant special effects drag spawn down mtv style jerky your face editing one them flames for example roll across the screen sometimes announce shift setting cogliostro unlikely wannabe guide for spawn serves poor narrator for the film goofily tells the audience one point that how much spawn humanity left remains seen the audience really cares one violent sequence leads another the music finally assaults the audience much the manic violence and offensive dialogue loud and obnoxious hard rock fused with drum loops dominate some scenes fair however marilyn manson long hard road out hell effectively compliments spawn return earth while filter and the crystal method can you trip like proves surprisingly fitting theme song for good comic book spawn did not spawn good movie spawn instead suffers from too much pomp and circumstance and too little plot and character development receives two stars for its technically well done special effects many other films though have equal not superior special effects and are much better rated spawn seems more violent than many rated movies and probably wouldn appropriate for the very young

 |text much wanted like this film went into the more pleased was when left first getting through all the usual lines newspaper glitz you liked scream you love wild things campbell gives stunning performance this twisty plot will have you dazzled for days yeah the day newspaper uses these the day neve campbell falls love with now onto more serious stuff and with this film mean that nearly sarcastic way wild things has single handedly broken down the rules surrounding the rating from the mpaa not saying that bad way but when you see this film you may shocked what you see however perhaps the mpaa was pleased the film charming cast and tricky plot that they let the film slide with rating being mormon bound hear uproar from religious zealots warning not see the film trouble have already seen and like wild things film noir the 90s filled with 40s sensibilities and yet breaking the rules and modern day taboos 90s culture the style which filmed rich color the actors are all gorgeous people seemingly drawn from the same gene pool and placed into this film sure all too good true but ain fun watch when movies like this come along sort better version basic instinct there bound people who either love hate there will people who don want admit liking what they see but tell you most anyone who sees this will like wild things begins blue bay high school the one high school the world that any teenager would love get into almost students are put through entrance exams just for admittance totally based looks alone course there are those select few who may look slightly ugly but compared the average person they are gorgeous immediately the film finds its tone and the audience settles for enjoyable time can turn off our brains right wrong while you may expecting one thing happen certainly doesn turn out that way the film begins classroom with nearly all the main characters present there sam lombardo matt dillon counselor for the students heading the class discussion there also kelly van ryan denise richards snobby rich teen who has fallen love with sam teaching the class however are two policemen ray duquette kevin bacon and gloria perez daphne rubin vega who want talk about sex cheers crimes boos what sex crime ray asks not gettin any one student responds this pretty much sets the tone the film are about watch however upon hearing this one student suzie toller neve campbell stands and leaves the room commenting that they can both kiss part her body and wild things sets into motion quickly kelly begins hitting sam but sam doesn want anything with her advances kelly stubborn and continues pursue him she even pleads with him let her wash his jeep surprisingly that really all can tell you about the plot any more would give away one the many crucial plot twists and what more these plot twists are actually unpredictable going along the way scream wild things maintains that film surprises and then adds even more them there are more plot twists this film than probably any have ever seen and even though you think you may get tired them the surprises are genuine that rather pleasing going back over them mind nearly all them work though some stretch the boundaries belief thankfully the convoluted plot doesn give much time think about each one pouncing yet another twist before the shock the previous one has worn off for the critics who complain that the film trashy well this pretty much just one trashy film however the kind trashy that isn hard watch good trash sense one the screenplay knows that not taken seriously and includes lot humor and satire into the story this varies everywhere from kelly mother theresa russell who more caricature rich people all the way ambulance chasing lawyer bill murray who wears neck brace cover insurance scam running bill murray also provides the best character the film and most the genuine laughs and two the sex more than gratuitous although not unwelcomed wild things supposed have sex what film with that title wouldn and this movie breaks the boundaries instead having heterosexual sex scenes also includes lesbian scenes between denise richards and neve campbell don worry not graphic you might think the heterosexual scenes are quite graphic but the surprise shocker kevin bacon full frontal nude scene very brief you blink you may miss ahem and for long can remember don think have seen rated film show erect one before not completely but judging from the audiences reaction was more than they expected too also during one scene late the film there seemed relationship brewing between bacon and dillon characters but nothing came makes you wonder the director had cut order for the rating the actors refused what first made want see wild things was its cast neve campbell course has been one favorite actresses since the scream films were released here however she turns every typical role she has done its head and plays gothic pothead the closest role this was her performance the craft though even that she was nice girl campbell probably the best the film and shows her wide range talent you can tell she will around for long time denise richards will also around for long time although she may limited the roles without much range here she gets express more emotions than her stiff yet effective performance starship troopers hopefully one day she will land very good role that can display her ability and then there daphne rubin vega newcomer the movies she gives very good performance although her character mostly left the background for the first hour and half towards the

rating the language quite harsh too ranging from sexual innuendo your average everyday profanity and can stress enough don allow kids under see this film the target age for the movie the range and that who should see definitely not for those under did mention that this film rated however for those that get chance watch you will probably more likely pleased and may even take friends see the next

 |text film critics have morals are there any unwritten laws ethical movie critic would should follow naturally don want into film with any preconceived notions which pretty tough but something all have accomplish secondly and along the same line can prejudge film because stars director etc the difference well the first one into film thinking going dumb going good and that would affect our viewing that movie sounds and looks dumb not expecting much the second hand simply assuming will bad good because personal grudge against the film company made disney just merchandising ploy then the actors jim carrey gonna stink the director who can that good this more biased viewpoint opposed first impression viewpoint make sense but what about comparing isn that kind along the same lines when compare certain actor director even composer credibility one film another they were involved that really fair sure sequels you can expect and accept comparisons lot more but what about jackie brown for example fair for take the review and turn into comparison pulp fiction just because quentin tarantino directed and wrote the screenplay for both think and tell you why good critic should able view the film from the average joe jane viewpoint while still taking into account the artistic integrity behind the film sometimes that can tough the acting was superb but was bored loved was sooooo cheezy might used describe film these are contradictions and critic has weigh both sides and come suitable balanced critique but which more important and which better extremely well shot and acted film that boring really amateurish film that you wanna back again and again getting back the point philosophy comparing films being fair works because reflecting what the public wants know anyway every average person out there who interested this film likely ask how does compare pulp fiction and critic already responsible ask that same question jackie brown stars pam grier the blaxploitation heroine from the 1970 who likely make big comeback thanks her role the title character tarantino pulp fiction big part responsible for john travolta sudden revival the movie industry and with talks oscar nomination the same likely happen for grier made thru comparison jackie year old airline stewardess who brings extra cash and probably her main revenue smuggling large sums money into the united states for ordell robbie pulp fiction samuel jackson and comparison ordell the illegal firearms business and has enlisted the aid louis gara robert niro bank robber who just got out prison after serving four years help him accomplish scheme worth half million dollars trouble arises when jackie stopped atf agent ray nicolet michael keaton and taken into custody for possession narcotics well having more money than allowed airport without being claimed naturally this proves obstacle ordell plans and not friendly intended hope posts jackie bail after she put behind bars the thing ordell this for one more than himself and learn from his previous actions willing kill anyone who stands the way jackie finds herself tight squeeze ordell won think twice about taking her out she fails help him she always done yet the same time compromise with the authorities would order evidence against ordell was provided comes down simple question would jackie rather face ordell prison what ensues rich and intriguing example storytelling question who jackie really out help the law ordell maybe just herself coming into play another veteran robert forster jackie bail bondsmen max cherry max obvious fondness for jackie will become major benefactor her fight beat both sides the system and forster plays him with subtle charm that adds depth unbrewed romance also involved ordell surfer girl girlfriend melanie bridget fonda ditzy sun bleached babe who spends her time watching with bong hand fonda does the best she can with essentially thin role but there nothing more her and therefore she becomes tossable addition otherwise flourishing bouquet characters niro also wasted his role quiet nobody crook out score few bucks for himself niro brilliant actor but character who hardly ever speaks doesn need niro play him compared pulp fiction comparison the characters jackie brown and very thin and replaceable pulp fiction even the small seemingly irrelevant characters were wonderful complete and lifelike whereas jackie brown has such common figures that wouldn have suffered much with lesser talented cast the exception being grier tarantino wrote this script with grier specifically mind say that she made for this role reversed truth sadly grier too could have received bit more attention especially when the story all about her newly jarred perception life jackson teams with tarantino again but the chemical reaction isn awesome the first time jules was the rambling bible quoting hitman pulp fiction and jackson the only person who could have pulled off and although jackson really really good jackie brown don think quite irreplaceable fact maybe new face would have been better jackson could remained tarantino jules and new guy could have become ordell forever remain our memories sadly these characters are too much the same except ordell just isn impressive and putting this the hands jackson once again only going deter from our fond recollections jules another problem that ordell way too focused the beginning this grier film why spend long getting know man who will become more supporting character the film progresses not only makes the movie feel little too slanted but makes for slow beginning because have take longer getting the meat the story likely that those pouring into the theater see this film are going those anxious partake tarantino quirky dialogue and eccentric directing style and not much those interested seeing silver screen adaption elmore leonard novel rum punch for those movie goers don expect another pulp fiction and you satisfied for the script oozes with the familiar brash qualities that has made tarantino icon film making the directing has toned down bit however yet still reminded that this tarantino movie thanks odd split screen story telling devices and scenes being replayed multiple times from different viewpoints getting back the question that began with this isn pulp fiction all good but isn anything that made pulp fiction such revolutionary effort the first place this more conservative tarantino but not one that won satiate true fans you can realize that this isn going knock your socks off then you happy least let massage your feet after all all know how much tarantino loves that particular part the human anatomy

 |text warning this review contains some spoilers for the 1964 film fail safe you haven seen the film yet proceed with caution nutshell relevant intelligent suspenseful drama still powerful today even after the end the cold war fail safe usa 1964 drama 111 minutes screenplay walter bernstein based the novel eugene burdick and harvey wheeler produced max youngstein directed sidney lumet review jamahl epsicokhan the most ironic aspect nuclear war that doesn have winning side and losing side nuclear confrontation everybody loses and the aftereffects have devastating effects that impact the entire world assuming the world survives the idea and perhaps the only real option avoid war all costs this the theme sidney lumet fail safe fictional drama based the novel eugene burdick and harvey wheeler fail safe takes place during the heart the cold war the actual film was released two years after the cuban missile crisis when the united states and the soviet union were static discord over issue that can summarized single word communism the premise centers around combination accidents and operation flaws five bombers carrying nuclear warheads are ordered set routine course for moscow after unidentified aircraft spotted heading toward america the unidentified aircraft turns out commercial airliner but mechanical failure strikes the military base that commands the bombers suddenly out contact and with standing orders remain course until receiving new directives the bomber pilots cannot recalled and they proceed moscow with the intention destroying with nuclear strike great deal fail safe plot follows various characters they attempt devise ways stopping the bombers from reaching russia borders any cost the plot compelling and the story creates urgency and dread painting the grimmest worst case scenarios the reality sets quickly one attempt turn the bombers after another fails general bogan frank overton taking orders directly from the president the united states himself henry fonda powerless the fate the world lies the hands automated pre programmed system that may not stoppable simply because the creators the war machines were too efficient their task make win situation winnable the events fail safe are fascinating because they anything but predictable but the real reason fail safe works because understands more about nuclear war than what exists within the confines its plot key ingredient the film its ability create ongoing polemic about nuclear war communism the cold war and the united states role all most this through the film use the character groeteschele walter matthau arrogant civilian theorist nuclear weapons use who incidentally the president advising staff for analyzing the statistical plausibility waging nuclear war many the film most pointed messages arise from discussions where groeteschele one the key voices early the film hosts dinner party where explains the importance strategy nuclear assault minimize casualties what the difference between million and 100 million dead guest asks impatiently forty million groeteschele responds wryly the problem with groeteschele mindset that believes nuclear combat viable method war the only difference him between nuclear armageddon and conventional warfare the raw data and the casualty totals groeteschele realizes that these weapons can destroy the world several times over yet his answer the arms race not slow down and try cool the situation off general black dan herlihy has often recommended the contrary according groeteschele that would lead russia having more nuclear weapons than the which would clearly put america disadvantage such stance was perhaps the central paradox and misguided practice the arms race fail safe clearly sees one the central issues the cold war and likewise becomes central theme the film why continue build such machines mass destruction while already possessing enough them destroy the world several times over wise even logical not really although fail safe more about the issue nuclear weapons than about the political ramifications communism there scene the film that deals with communism intentionally superficial one sided sort way again this achieved through groeteschele who easily the film most important character terms the larger theme significance addition providing the central pro nuclear war voice that the film warns against also makes key remarks about communists that show just how much fear and resentment people the period were prone when came communism the context the film uses suggests that this hatred was often glib one groeteschele logical trains thought ventures far into fantasy theoretical prediction that merely absurd labels the average marxist unfeeling calculating machine that will whatever takes preserve itself groeteschele takes far say that the drops the warhead moscow the soviets will instantly surrender for retaliate would invite counter measures that would further destroy russia home soil which must preserved all costs groeteschele seems forget these people are human beings with emotions general black quickly reminds him that the soviets would attack out revenge any normal person would the irony here groeteschele own mechanical theorizing quick judge the enemy that doesn even realize his own seemingly programmed thought patterns once the film makes evident that turning the bombers will impossible the question becomes what the consequences destroying moscow will just how will the soviet union leader react and what can the president convey his best intentions just how does one pass off the deaths millions people mishap with the help his translator buck larry hagman the president negotiates length with the soviet leader scenes that prove amazingly taut and powerful their simplicity with lumet long takes fonda and hagman the same frame exchanging the dialog between the president and the soviet leader without getting into too much detail will say that the compromise they ultimately reach very costly yet necessary and sensible possible under the circumstances that sensible nuclear incident can probably does accomplish what must avoids all out war something that simply isn possible because its all too real consequences dramatically the ending quite powerful and the use herlihy character the symbolic matador providing bookend the film ending the story while tying into his dream sequence from the film opening particularly appropriate fail safe production major hollywood studio released columbia pictures and has the structure high tension suspense thriller that one might expect from hollywood film nevertheless under lumet direction and walter bernstein intelligent adaptation burdick and wheeler novel the film continues have lasting effect even after the events screen have unfolded the film often warns that the automation war something that may make nuclear holocaust unintentional consequence such mass arming but was the conscious human choice initialize this automatic arming that fail safe also finds dangerous retrospect the arms race seems one the most puzzling exercises futility the century just fortunate that both sides were finally able come their senses and slow down rather than continuing groeteschele dangerous approach speeding and causing possible meltdown

 |text people who enjoy science fiction are often faced with unpleasant surprises due the improper labelling novels stories comic books movies often science fiction aficionados find material previously labelled science fiction pure fantasy supernatural horror rather simple techno thriller such cases mistakes are understandable genre boundaries are never clearly marked but believe there are really few cases when movie labelled science fiction actually happens straight historical epic such thing occurred former yugoslavia some fifteen years ago when national distributors gave such treatment the right stuff 1983 film directed philip kaufman the mistake the distributors could explained with the fact that the official poster the film features men space suits but the right stuff film isn even fiction was based the non fiction book tom wolfe covering the early years american space program the plot the film begins 1947 when few people heard edwards air force base major test site for experimental planes the major aim test flights determine ability manned aircraft reach mach speed and thus break the sound barrier many pilots tried achieve that goal and many paid with their lives for such bravado but one quiet pilot chuck eager played sam shaped succeeds and thus gives example for whole new generation test pilots determined enter history books breaking new speed records ten years later soviets have launched sputnik marking the beginning the space age order regain national prestige government decides the first send man into space best air force navy and marine pilots are recruited into program but not yeager because lacks college education and desired all american image one critics polls the right stuff was named one among top films made 1980s such high position could explained with the fact that kaufman film looks quite atypical for its time with more than three hours length and epic scope looked more suitable for 1950s and 1960s age when hollywood used make films larger than life but the real reason lies the fact that was made truly remarkable and talented filmmaker philip kaufman created reputation 1970s using all the opportunities that golden age order create original memorable movies the right stuff was the last them swan song era when producers allowed directors spend big bucks unusual risk taking artsy projects the right stuff unusual because lacks many standard elements hollywood film the plot almost non existent and not very coherent the story featuring many interesting incidents and anecdotes shifts focus from the old generation test pilots embodied yeager new generation the astronauts the film also lacks conventional protagonist yeager who also appears small cameo remains the true hero the film but equal time and exposure also given other astronauts and their wives making this movie into ensemble piece that gave opportunity for kaufman use multitude great acting talents until that specialised only for bit character roles sam shepard great yeager war hero whose greatest achievement breech the sound barrier remained obscured history books probably due his own modesty the surface lacks personality compared with his hyped and more fortunate astronaut colleagues but shepard gives texture this character with subtle gestures and phrases shepard performance followed with great acting harris clean cut marine and future politician john glenn young dennis quaid more than fine arrogant fighter jock gordo cooper and this arrogance mirrored his friend and most tragic figure virgil grissom superbly played fred ward always reliable character actor scott glenn provides some comic relief navy aviator and arguably first american man space alan shepard kaufman left room for female talents excel too barbara hershey pamela reed veronica cartwright and mary deschanel are great pilots wives royal dano also impressive menacing figure preacher but the most memorable performances belong donald moffat vice president lyndon johnson and jane dornacker nurse murch great acting talent assembled for this film was mirrored with kaufman superb direction most notable all the methods kaufman uses order suggest the passage time the beginning the film shows test pilots living the middle desert virtual unknowns far away from strict rules and discipline everything seems natural yeager can indulge himself horse riding just few yards away from the fastest and most precious aircraft the world that setting quite normal for important technical problems solved with simple chainsaw and for the test pilots not report their ribs being broken before most important flights but the times are changing ww2 alliance with ussr replaced with cold war and natural pilots like yeager must replaced with more disciplined conventional pilots their entire lives become focus media frenzy and their job subjected strict rules meticulous plans and they must fight the bureaucrats publicity seeking politicians and uncaring scientists like former nazi rocket expert werner von braun played scott beach only preserve their most basic human dignity this contrast underlined with the beautifully edited sequence while yeager conducts his final and most spectacular test flight absolute obscurity mercury astronauts receive fame and fortune although some them even before going the space those contrasts and similar effects are achieved with kaufman superb use poetic movie language editing great and photography caleb deschanel provides many memorable scenes like the funeral the desert astronauts their suits walking slow motion the same image would copied many latter films although kaufman enjoyed support nasa and american military which provided authentic locations and period equipment still had use special effects order simulate space flights those effects are excellent and they can still fool the audience accustomed cgi and real footage earth from outer space another fine contribution this film oscar awarded musical score bill conti still tremble from excitement every time hear accompanied with the use holst and debussy some the songs used the background also provide authentic atmosphere the historical period this film great and its cult status well deserved but there are some minor flaws some the mercury astronauts aren fleshed out enough although being played fine actors like lance henriksen film also lacks proper closure the other hand most logical conclusion the film landing the moon would require this film more than six hours long also some critics were prone attack this film too amerocentric and hard russians who were portrayed evil monsters just line with most virulent cold war rhetoric reagan america some contemporary interviews kaufman defended that approach claiming that wanted make film authentic possible and order that portrayed russians not they were real life but they were perceived americans early 1960s time has passed now don see astronauts heroes this age widespread satellite communications and routine space missions those men and women space suits are seen mere maintenance workers few young boys want astronauts when they grow but this film sentimental reminder the times when future began perhaps could encourage least some them follow mercury astronauts footsteps seek new frontiers the sky and even they decide stay earth they could still appreciate the right stuff extraordinary piece cinema

 |text the summer wasn very good one for devout cinephiles offered blair witches sixth senses the best big budget hollywood could was efficient men adaptation and flawed but entertaining shaft update nurse betty signals the unofficial end that dreadful summer movie season and the commencement potentially brighter fall movie season that battery charging least for critics who have sit through every piece shit that moseys into multiplexes time year when all those oscar contenders read quality films compete for audiences alas betty has the dubious distinction being the first overpraised junk heap the new season also indie director neil labute first attempt something resembling mainstream picture and sad report resounding failure least this web site mess that hopelessly saccharine people have accused labute previous films being unrelentingly masochistic went expecting something decent for betty was gleefully praised screenplay even winning award cannes but exited shaking noggin bewilderment are critics desperate for something unique that they blind how derivative the particular brand uniqueness betty dolls out for the first time labute working from script has not written and seems unsure how handle the material betty tries hip like pulp fiction this another flick featuring pair strangely bright and articulate hit men enchanting like the wizard which this film makes several allusions and heartwarming like stick your favorite loveable misfit movie but the end left cold with its calculated desperation labute half hearted attempt make crowd pleaser and doesn even seem have half that heart nurse betty concerns soap opera addict betty brilliantly played renee zellweger who witnesses the killing her husband del aaron eckhart playing the most casually loutish husband since richard benjamin diary mad housewife two hit men morgan freeman and chris rock she happens have her most beloved soap the background and somehow merges the two realities she blocked out her husband death and thinks she character her favorite soap reason love betty sets out the road with some drugs unknowingly stashed her car trunk searching for her soap boyfriend david ravell greg

then fell straight his ass with bash play penned that was recently aired showtime the play demonstrated forward movement artist only labute persistence wallowing the horrid things average people each

his clueless girlfriend essentially regards his sadistic behaviors something along the old maxim boys will boys another character schlubby businessman reacts the loss his job actually killing his own baby what was once powerful about labute work the casual nonchalant cruelty and selfishness often elements all have amplified disgusting degree had become over the top was borderline comic obviously this point labute could use dose some different kind material before pigeon holes himself further but nurse betty isn clearly has little passion for what doing here instead replacing his mojo with strained quirks one the hit men huge soap fan and the character betty would little more than one joke gimmick zelllweger hadn managed transcend that tailor made appeal the widest possible audience nearly every scene between chris rock and morgan freeman fatally slows the picture down the two are made enact soft boiled tarantino esque dialogue they evince little chemistry with rock constantly over the top rant mode acting more like angry comic than any thing resembling hit man occupation that represented far too frequently movies nowadays think rock great comic yet hasn been able bring his feral intelligence movies whenever acts and matter the part like doing the damn chris rock show surprisingly least considering her work myself and irene renee zellweger gives revelatory performance building her baby faced apple pie looks that wide open face and helium voiced earnestness suggests little girl not fully grown into her thirty year old body the best work she ever done freeman effective always though his performance nonetheless suffers because seems odds with where the movie wants take the actor plays the role his usual calm collected manner though the flick tries insinuate symbolic kinship between his character and betty suggesting that both are controlled their fantasies rather than reality that interesting but the movie doesn anything with other than crash land the sub theme into labored speech the midst badly staged gun battle the film has good moments many the scenes involving very good greg kinnear especially his confrontation with zellweger almost soothing lyrical score and you know movie trouble when the score sticks out one the best things about but nothing jells parts good bad are disparate opposing the film might have worked had settled being one type film mainstream female forrest gump oddball art film but both falls flat diet coke betty screenplay makes the mistake relying too much concurrence without which betty wouldn make any progress the film nurse betty film driven coincidence rather than charter like how betty becomes nurse the film job that she takes order get closer her imaginary lover she happens the hospital the exact moment that drive shooting takes place and miraculously knows how take care the victim wound because she happened see how which leads her being offered room with the victim girlfriend who eventually gets betty into party where she meets kinnear little too tidy don tcha think betty has interesting theme though doesn even seem aware this the current state has been leaning towards reality television what with the enormous success survivor and moderate success big brother with more the way this film about women deluded think that her favorite soap opera reality ironically real life survivor sean kennif has taken part doctor the soap opera guiding light instead exploring this timely matter way relating the current craze since the film does largely appear satire television albeit one that would feel more appropriate the 80s than the 00s the film simply uses betty delusions plot device get her from point progress made and little unearthed except that maybe labute could use bit rest and lot

 |text warning spoilers are included this review but doesn really make much difference deep impact begins the official summer movie season and also brings back memories 1997 remember when dante peak came out february few months later volcano was released the first film was smart exhilirating and one the best disaster films had ever seen the latter film was incohesive mess that defied logic and wasted talent well deja all over again two disaster films head head competition this time unfortunately the first comet flick bad that people may shy away from armageddon the upcoming comet disaster released the beginning july course the general reaction the audience was oppposed mine and the minority was when stood the side dante peak but while watching deep impact began wonder how anyone their right mind could actually like this film apparently many did and utterly baffles completely honest haven had this little fun watching disaster film entire life volcano had implausibilities the wazoo but was still rather fun watch deep impact doesn just have implausibilities also contains cheap human drama incredibly horrible special effects and poorly constructed plot the only thing that gives half star above bottom ranking slightly entertaining final fifteen minutes and some good actors making the most their characters deep impact begins unnamed year the year varies advanced technology sets the future but fire the sky showing local movie theater pushing back 1993 line students outside night peering through telescopes the dark sky above among these are leo biederman elijah wood and sarah hotchner leelee sobieski leo unknowingly discovers comet and his teacher sends photo the unknown object astronomer who then able determine the correct path this distant comet about few seconds races off mail the information but killed reckless car accident year passes and nothing heard about again are then introduced jenny lerner leoni reporter for msnbc she gets handed job investigate possible cover the government involving senator alan rittenhouse james cromwell she talks woman who mentions that rittenhouse was having affair with girl named ellie after talking with rittenhouse and unsatisfied with the information she gets she decides use the internet for help luckily she knows exactly how spell the certain ellie that she looking for they spell ele the film that girl pretty darn smart for guessing how was spelled before she can use the information the government decides push her car off the road they take her meet the president the united states president beck morgan freeman beck recommends that jenny keep the information secret for hours they can confirm and then hold press conference naturally she wants compensated and they offer her front row seat and the chance for the first question and yada yada yada they reveal the comet the public and their plans send massive spacecraft out destroy before can arrive they announce plan called ark which their only hope for survival computer will select 800 000 people random these people are the ones who will into large cave underground that the impact the comet won kill off the entire human race after two years the dust will settle actually would take much much longer approximately ninety years from what understand and the humans could come back the surface and start over the rest the plot your standard disaster film procedures but there one subplot worth mentioning jenny and her father jason maximilian schell have very touching relationship that forms out the impending doom the final moment involving the two characters heartfelt and emotional shame that nothing else heartfelt now course all know that the comet does impact the surface the title alone suggests and the previews actually show doing this absoltuely tension can drawn from any attempt stop the comet because all know that won work director mimi leder came from her successful tries direction with episodes the hit television show her major film debut was the peacemaker pathetic and heartless action film well this time leder outdid herself creating film worse than that one suggestion leder please stay away from the big screen least the action genre much the blame can placed leder directly because the pace disastrously off throughout the film are given subtitles that tell how much time has passed goes from months weeks hours literally feels like this lapsed time taking place real time that boring course leder isn all blame for screenwriters michael tolkin and bruce joel rubin have crafted simplistic story that only gets worse with time what starts out promising soon turns deadly for the audience anyway chock full cheesy one liners you know you are going have more sex than anyone else school and stupid characters you might think were back the 70s again only one the subplots remotely interesting while the rest are forgettable and boring and the main plot outrageous that you can figure out this film supposed action drama sci put simply the special effects this film are hit and miss situation that right miss and hit scenes above the earth are well done and the orbiting ship majestic but the comet huge mistake making more laughable than frightening the concept even trying land comet preposterous enough but that forgiveable what isn forgiveable actually having humans walk the surface give break will and course the much hyped collision comet and earth well far from spectacular and makes independence day look brilliant the water rushing towards the land effective but once hits the continent the effects turn ridiculous cgi water used and looks bad that heard more laughs from the audience than shrieks fact may even recommend the film for those who want see how bad effects can actually get these days just when think visual effects can improved along comes film show that they really can and should one thing has struck wrong note with concerning mimi leder direction which also influences the actors leder loves show the actors faces before and during moments terror this reminded another action director renny harlin die hard cliffhanger but harlin succeeds because shows the faces the victims realistic situations leder likes flaunt people fears via their faces but instead coming off sympathetic leder seems more sadist one moment has astronaut flying off into space this should enough warrant response from the audience but leder wants farther and shows the person face while drifting into space this one the cheapest ways ellicit emotional response from audience and for one not going fooled another note leder film only picks its pace during the last fifteen minutes when the comet actually impacts the pace does pick and some very emotional moments are shown then again when you watch people cry for their loved ones obvious will emotional mostly just big trick rope viewers into feeling for the characters but didn work for but anyway the actors much they can with what they are given leoni bad boys the naked truth the best the film and she given the meatiest role her character made stronger leoni presence and grow care for her robert duvall energetic and fun watch but his character turned into shreds the plot elijah wood also comes off rather successfully but still hasn had many good roles wood stick drama you are too talented for this stuff vanessa redgrave barely acknowledgeable and her performance only enhanced her strong presence screen maximilian schell distracting but does provide some nice humor morgan freeman has been infinitely better than this and gives one his most shallow performances date which quite remarkable for him leelee sobieski could have been better but think she just suffered from poorly written character special note should ron eldard and denise crosby eldard good his role but limited the plot crosby special personally because she was tasha yar from star trek the next generation seeing her was one the highlights the film overall very talented cast virtually wasted deep impact rated for disaster related elements and brief language this one the worst films the year and any omen things come this summer could one the worst ever luckily the files movie coming and hopefully armageddon will more successful shame that this film will successfully because just isn worth much costing nearly million with special effects done the illustrious ilm which huge shocker and with score composed oscar winner james horner titanic one might have expected this more fun witness and experience well not when the comet does hit the earth you almost wish could just take this film along with

with dinosaurs munching human appetizers now following his 1993 pattern has fashioned another serious inspirational christmas release about the nature humanity that film amistad although not masterful schindler list amistad nevertheless gripping motion picture thematically rich impeccably crafted and intellectually stimulating the only area where this movie falls little short its emotional impact watching schindler list was powerful almost spiritual experience spielberg pulled into the narrative absorbed the drama then finally let exhausted and shattered three plus hours later aspects the movie have stayed with ever since amistad while fine example film making not transcendent the incident the ship amistad not found any history books but considering who writes the texts that not

abolitionists theodore joadson morgan freeman and lewis tappan stellan skarsgard they are soon joined roger baldwin matthew mcconaughey property attorney little repute aided advice from former

arrest our attention cinque the key viewers seeing the amistad africans more than symbols battle ideologies they are individuals and our ability make that distinction crucial the movie success amplify this point spielberg presents many scenes from the africans point view detailing their occasionally humorous observations about some the white man seemingly strange rituals the larger struggle course one defining humanity the nazis felt justified slaughtering jews because they viewed their victims sub human the pro slavery forces amistad use similar defense the abolitionists regard the africans

everything amistad presentation the legal and political intricacies surrounding the trial are fascinating making this movie one the most engrossing courtroom dramas recent history four claimants come forward against the africans the state which wants them tried for murder the queen spain who wants them handed over her under the provision american spanish treaty two american naval officers who claim the right high seas salvage and the two surviving spaniards from amistad who demand that their property returned them baldwin must counter all these claims while facing challenge his own preconceived notions the result relationship develops with cinque even though attorney and client are divided language barrier they gradually learn communicate aside from cinque who fully realized individual characterization spotty but the acting top notch matthew mcconaughey successfully overcomes his pretty boy image become baldwin but the lawyer never particularly well defined outside his role the amistad case likewise while morgan freeman and stellan skarsgard are effective joadson and tappan they are never anything more than abolitionists nigel hawthorne who played the title

 |text one the biggest cliches any serial killer film also one the most believable you know the one where the detective looks wall pictures and other police information and suddenly spots the clue which reveals who the killer sure been used over and over but for some reason always fun watch this cliche pretty much describes the level kiss the girls works overused but always fun one personal rules about watching film not how original the film but how goes around giving its story this rule applies highly kiss the girls there something psychologically stimulating well crafted serial killer movie and kiss the girls certainly well made however the whole film screams unoriginality and relies the power its actors and the technical detail pull through well not only are the actors capable pulling through but they add much the film that nearly every flaw covered unfortunately one the most revealing and rather insulting choices the filmmakers one that seven film lot like this one knew not make was put the name the killer the opening credits that may give the actor credit for the role but throughout the film hidden mind was waiting for him appear screen which spoiled the mystery however credit must given the director for suspending this knowledge through most the film plotwise kiss the girls shows almost originality are introduced detective alex cross morgan freeman forensic psychologist and immediately are given the cliched scene establishing him the hero gets call about woman who has shot her husband and now threatening kill herself obviously cross succeeds getting the gun but this scene quickly forgotten during the next scene his house cross told that his neice naomi gina ravera has been missing for four days this provides the motivation for cross find the killer but are never given chance establish the relationship between the two and result can sympathize with detective cross however what makes kiss the girls slightly original the introduction one the abductees before she abducted kate mctiernan ashley judd the actress the judd family smart athletic woman and because these traits becomes target for casanova what the serial killer likes call himself because these character developing scenes care for mctiernan making the abduction scene all that more suspenseful after being abducted mctiernan wakes and finds herself cell somewhere the woods remembering that the killer gave her certain rules she decides break one them calling out when casanova comes punish her she breaks out and escapes jumping over waterfall after she found she begins help cross find his neice from this moment kiss the girls takes the form every other serial killer film the two leads search for the rest the victims held captive many people will compare this film 1995 seven another killer film starring morgan freeman but presume that the similarities are intentional the screenplay david klass adapted from the novel written james patterson and yet don quite see how this story could have worked novel form what makes kiss the girls good the acting and the technical and visual impressiveness the cinematography aaron schneider reminiscient seven and sometimes felt that many the shots were trying too hard impress sometimes simple shot the best one however many the shots are stunning and unlike seven most them take place during the day sunlight the scene when ashley judd running through the forest extremely well done more than one way the camera work terrific but the editing makes this scene work well the chaotic and mtv type cutting gives the audience sense confusion and unawareness exactly what judd character experiencing however the best aspect kiss the girls its actors morgan freeman one today most powerful and believable actors detective cross very good character for him although just similar one the character seven because freeman powerful presence carries half the film himself the other half carried ashley judd one today most promising dramatic actresses fact her performance better than freeman that even possible her character more original than freeman and she handles wonderfully finally have female character movie like this who does more than just scream the supporting cast highly underdeveloped but the cast members much they can with cary elwes portrays cop north carolina and unfortunately has scraps for character tony goldwyn fairs slightly better but don really get know his character either gina ravera gives good performance but again she isn many the scenes result all these small supporting parts the weight the film lies the two leads and they phenomenal job some the best acting this genre and some the best acting the year two other essential aspects the film are quite good director gary fleder does good job controlling his actors but the second half the film loses believability especially during the revelation the killer also doesn handle the suspenseful scenes better director would have losing lot tension during many scenes however his credit does manage terrific first half part the blame falls david klass sure the book developed many the lesser characters more but klass focuses the two main parts while this may give the two leads more screentime many the small characters are one dimensional and the killer when revealed extremely implausible thanks the smart dialogue adapted from the novel kiss the girls always seems intelligent none the conversations are laughable and all move the plot forward without seeming forced one the biggest problems had with the movie was the motive the killer blame this mainly the casting director because the killer motive because rejection from women assume from the opening monologue but the killer himself very attractive one friends shall say big admirer the killer kiss the girls rated for terror violence language and suggested sex with all the implausibilities this film and with the mediocre second half kiss the girls somehow manages thoroughly entertain fact had the urge see again just for the performances the cinematography adds lot mood the already creepy tone and the script usually smart this clearly one those movies which rely the acting pull through morgan freeman possibly today most convincing actor and ashley judd adds another notch her acting belt must also say that loved the ending the showdown between good

vampire movies since the topics are alike ravenous starts wonderfully and continues shock and scare until gets the finale where looses focus and gets too primitive and rather boring however these little failures don diminish the impression this bizarre dark comedy about the human mind and its change different situations scary fable about the monster that lurks everyone soul dark side which all

 |text logical time travel movies are near impossibility considering that the skeptic best argument against the possibility time travel the idea altered realities writing script that deals with this problem imposing task occasionally get film that does manage terry gilliam monkeys was one such film but more frequently get films that don much deal with all there one question ask this case does the film have other virtues that override the existing logical inconsistencies the terminator films made for them with exciting action back the future did with entertaining story and the new film frequency pulls off the trick with strong package its own frequency filled with plot holes yes does matter not really the film opens october 1969 firefighter frank sullivan dennis quaid puts his life the line every time suits for his job then goes home his loving wife julia elizabeth mitchell and son johnny daniel henson the double pronged story flashes forward 1999 where johnny now jim caviezel all grown and working police detective strange occurrence the appearance aurora borealis over new york city allows father and son communicate through the same ham radio frank used and that john has found the present day though both are initially skeptical the idea john eventually takes this opportunity warn his father against his impending death warehouse fire and succeeds saving frank from certain doom now flooded with memories full life with his father alive john initially overjoyed until discovers that the changes the timeline have been disastrous serial killer that would have died has instead lived kill seven more women frank and john now must work together set things right with john using the information has gathered the future instruct frank what the past the premise frequency unusual and requires getting over one very important mental hurdle fully accept john and frank are the only ones conscious how the timeline has been changed result their actions this isn explained you just have with when frank doesn die fire john the only one who remembers differently while everyone else remembers the new way the concept also runs into problems concerning just how synchronous the two realities 1969 and 1999 are each other sometimes frank changing the past results something happening right away john world and sometimes john gets the changes ahead time now the filmmakers might have perfectly good explanations for this and could probably come with something fairly convoluted but nevertheless logical thought about hard enough for example the reason john gets advance information the serial killer murders was because the change had already happened frank world and john only witnessing the projection that change but explanations aren really the point when frequency gets cooking riveting little thriller even confusing what matters film like this the plot makes sense the moment and frequency works long keeps moving the film manages engaging despite the logical confusion director gregory hoblit and screenwriter toby emmerich structure frequency good hollywood entertainment establishing decent likable characters making care for them and setting goal reached and conflict resolved liked many the creative touches the split screens allowing see how the universe being affected both realities and the greater framework baseball drive the action forward actually uses the 1969 mets orioles world series the one that featured the amazin mets great effect frank uses john advance knowledge the series outcome convince his friends believe him admittedly this device may only interest baseball fan like myself even liked the final scene which features frank and john both fighting the same man simultaneously different time periods some may find this scene blindingly confusing the reality shifts start coming fast and furious but does make sense you think about and give the script lot leeway and let face darn cool way end the film there are enough surprises and plot twists frequency keep you your toes and result the movie avoids growing stagnant the other major thing appreciate about frequency the handling the father son relationship quaid and caviezel carry off their parts easily rock solid job from both actors the relationship instantly credible because they find the human truth behind the high concept how would one react being able communicate with dead relative with future descendant watching the exchanges between frank and john will give you pretty good idea how answer that question the credibility the human relationship absolutely crucial the rest the film don believe the characters don care about the outcome the thriller plot here care because like the lead actors also liked some the supporting cast members elizabeth mitchell gets stuck with two thankless roles playing julia the doting wife and mother but still performs admirably andre braugher late the television show homicide life the street gives nice supporting turn frank best friend and future colleague john has lovely scene diner which tries explain the situation julia while frank world series predictions come true before his very eyes braugher strikes the perfect facial expression here simultaneously dismayed and amused perhaps the only thing didn like about frequency the overly sentimental coda during which the camera focus goes little too soft and the baseball theme gets carried overboard but that only because the film had already earned poignancy without resorting cheap tactics freely acknowledge that frequency may best work guy movie since focuses the very male oriented idea father son relationships echoes field dreams can easily heard but the underlying concept universally applicable who wouldn want speak with long dead parent see how their children turn out tell about your life son excuse while mist and don call sissy

 |text labelling sometimes everything original mad max the opening title set the plot the movie near future thus making one the science fiction classics despite the future world being almost exactly like our own walter hill wanted the same opening title for his action classic the warriors producers weren thrilled that idea and consequently the movie lost all its futuristic overtones the other hand producers were right the mark walter hill was accused actually promoting some disturbing trends that were quite visible contemporary america make the movie even more distant from future plot was loosely based anabasis historical book written xenophon greek mercenary soldier who had described his adventures ancient persia 2400 years ago instead ancient persia movie begins contemporary coney island where cleon dorsey wright leader the warriors local youth gang gets invitation the great gathering all youth gangs from the city the gathering organised gramercy park riffs most powerful gang the city taking place bronx that far away from warriors home territory but small and unarmed delegation the warriors gets there safely thanks the general truce the gathering cyrus roger hill charismatic leader the riffs announces his grand plan unite all the gangs and take over the city crowd enthusiastic but the small gang rogues led psychopathic luther david patrick kelly uses the opportunity assassinate cyrus police simultaneously raids the gathering and the commotion warriors get blamed the killing and their leader gets killed riffs the remaining eight led cleon lieutenant swann michael beck must now try get coney island but this time unprotected truce and instead being chased all the gangs upon its release despite the controversies and even some youth riots that were allegedly inspired the warriors enjoyed immense popularity and very quickly received some kind cult status however despite being one the best movies that year and being directed talented action director walter hill the peak his career the movie failed leave strong impression the future generations some other cinematic achievements that same year the reason for that probably lies fact that this movie aged very quickly walter hill idea was warn the public about problems urban america failed miserably the future was much worse than his vision the youth gangs presented the warriors are far from shadowy armies able take over entire cities their members seem more interested unorthodox fashion and their little petty feuds than such prosaic and for the public more annoying matters like crime their vocabulary word arms reserved for small knives and blunt objects and only few them use heavy artillery like handguns they even have their own very strict and detailed laws upheld more strictly than some governments with their own many people american cities would more than happy see their young criminals behaving like those the warriors some the critics who accused hill actually praising youth crime had lot arguments their favour despite those objections the warriors have all the elements very good film the plot simple and serves good basis for numerous action scenes the fights are brilliantly choreographed and quite realistic although there isn much bloodshed gore the movie editing superb events happen quick pace with the exception middle when boring moralistic exchanges between swann and his would girlfriend mercy deborah van valkenburgh drag the plot from straight action social drama territory the soundtrack barry vorzon very suggestive and recognisable yet the trademark this film are the actors who showed great talent although most them later sunk into anonymity best known them david patrick kelly whose superb and original performance this film later subscribed him the roles psychopathic villains michael beck cool almost statesman like leader gang also very good and james remar gives good contrast his hot shot contender for top spot all all this movie perhaps dated yet its hour and half can give lot more entertainment than most the contemporary movies

 |text alien the only alien film have seen theaters saw when was years old and must admit that didn like course was expecting aliens again and believe this was fault order appreciate alien you need see aliens but you also have wipe away all the expectations from its predecessor james cameron aliens was action film and many people consider the best the series among that group but alien extremely entertaining film which critics have bashed for its originality many thought the final chase scene went for too long and many others thought that the film was too much dialogue and not enough action both are untrue because the film has quite bit action and the dialogue was essential and well written for the chase sequence was long but not overly long creating quite bit suspense from confusion perhaps watching alien video helped the big screen was overwhelmed something normally didn see was very dark film and the language was extremely harsh had always figured the alien series rely smart dialogue instead moronic profanities don get wrong not saying films should eliminate swearing but when film substitutes dialogue with these profane remarks gets rather distracting however since seeing again realize that the swearing mainly just aspect the restrained hatred the characters result alien only flaw albeit major one the underdeveloped characters never really care about any them and get the feeling that many scenes were cut order shorten the length the movie there were only two characters liked and course one was ripley sigourney weaver although have gotten know her through two other films the other character was clemens charles dance but because like him the inevitable occurs alien begins exactly where aliens left off the prologue alien pure cinematic achievement director david fincher who had only directed music videos before his chance with this alien entry without using single line dialogue unless you count computer warnings fincher sets the entire film impressive aspect this that fincher only shows few seconds film before cutting title card see ripley and the little girl their cryogenic compartments title shot alien egg title alien legs stretch into the air title and and during these first ten minutes learned everything had order for alien proceed quite remarkable opening and one which will remain mind for long time because this face hugger which has been hatched aboard the vessel from aliens the hypersleep containers are sent into escape pod and sent down the nearest planet fiorina fury 161 ore refinery which has been turned into maximum security prison however the face hugger managed attach itself one the cryo tubes and sent down with the escape pod unfortunately during the landing all but one the survivors from aliens killed ripley discovered some the inmates and taken back the refinery course you need carrier for this face hugger and attachs itself the dog which came with the team inmates ripley revived and asks see the ship after seeing mysterious acid eaten section ripley asks see the dead bodies and then have them cremated this cremation scene one the most powerful and impressive all the alien films featuring monologue from dillon charles dutton prisoner who has found god the movie cuts back and forth from the ceremony the dog demise one the most memorable moments the speech reflects exactly what going with the dog and this where alien succeeds fincher normally injects lot symbolism into his films and can easily see him becoming the next stanley kubrick alfred hitchcock fact the mixture both fincher knows exactly what film and how film and figure that will one the few directors with complete control over his films alien riddled with symbolic speeches and metaphorical images doing fincher creates some the best scenes the entire alien franchise many people have criticized fincher filming the death scene ripley reveal nothing saying this looking too fake but enjoy and relish the portrayal showing ripley fall slow motion nice touch but actually not showing her hit the vat iron great deal symbolism derived feel that would have spoiled the mood the entire film they had actually shown her splash into the molten iron however most people seem want witness ripley die which creates paradox she the character didn want see die why she killed one the surprises the film and don plan spoiling that this review from every alien film comes several memorable moments which seem stick with you forever alien was course the moment the alien burst out kane stomach aliens was the showdown between alien and ripley machine alien has several but most memorable the terrific shot involving the alien and ripley ripley pushed against wall and the alien stands inches away from her why doesn kill her shocker which later leads surprise ending fincher apparently loves use close ups actors faces michael douglas and the clown face off the game the same style and shaving off the actors hair the only thing have look their faces many critics didn like all the actors being bald but makes complete sense when taken context the plot most alien works when you take context the story but when you try compare its predecessors fincher turn seems bit gloomy and dark though that not always bad thing the plot pretty much rehash the first two films with some major twists again are setup with several different characters and one one they are picked off however while the first two had tons arsenal especially cameron film alien takes place planet devoid human life except for this run down prison result weapons are found this creates lot tension although must admit that fincher could have added lot more suspense alien film alien the worst the series but itself extremely well made motion picture with lot more merits than not the unfortunate thing surrounding this second sequel the one dimensional characters never was really emotionally involved screen because most the characters are hardcore criminals whom really could care less about despite this ripley was the central figure and that what important care for her even though she began act just like one the guys again the technical side this film remarkable and better than the two previous versions while cameron version was pumped action film with massive artillary fincher uses brilliant camera angles terrific lighting and moody sets the cinematography alex thomson very well done with terrific chase sequence towards the end the movie the confusion the ending draws the viewer are just confused the actors who are being chased around the yellows reds and oranges the lights create dark mood and themselves create lot suspense shadows dance the walls and yet those shadows could easily the alien the alien different from its predecessors this time around and the swiftness this alien quite intense the camera likes take the perspective the alien racing after the characters the sets are quite incredible which are reminiscient the nostromo from alien the narrow corridors and labrynthine hallways well constructed the sets appear the future but not too far the future one the set pieces even aids the destruction the alien nothing surprising there sigourney weaver turns out yet another good performance equaling her portrayal ripley aliens she was snubbed the oscars for this one mainly because the film was critical bomb her reactions are far more realistic this film with her crying over the loss the little child she risked her life saving her previous encounter quite touching really charles dutton very strong his performance one the inmates and was the brink actually caring for him charles dance turns nice low key performance and result cared for him immediately lance henriksen makes brief appearance bishop but was more entertaining aliens the rest the cast pretty stale though pete postlethwaite sticks out due his recent turns the usual suspects and the lost world alien rated for strong violence and language and sex although has its flaws alien highly entertaining with rich symbolism this film reminds you how much fun spot metaphorical images throughout movie while kubrick may have moral message throughout his films fincher relies cinematic devices bring his meanings out film like fincher which reminds that okay for film sacrifice quality for quantity the final scene fact tells that society have become too critical things which may happen look little fake whenever something looks fake screen immediately point out mistake but perhaps isn mistake

 |text the following review contains spoilers just the way are rapist matt frewer responds supergirl helen slater query why she being attacked example the mind numbingly bad dialogue supergirl admit love superman iii know hated amongst the superman faithful who dismiss nothing more than vehicle for richard pryor but still think worthy addition the man steel franchise supergirl spin off film sorts from the series same producers alexander and ilya salkind doesn even rival superman iii terms quality let alone superman superman supergirl lost from the opening scenes and went steadily downhill for the rest its two hour plus running time the film begins see the residents argo city commune like place consisting refugees from krypton which resides inner space about their daily lives what these are exiles from krypton which blew right were they living there before krypton exploded how you get inner space this whole inner space notion never explained particularly terms how these people get information from the outside world how they know where superman went how they know took the name clark kent and now works the daily planet these kinds things frustrate the hell out argo city kept running power source called the omegahedron one day the founder argo city zaltar peter toole gives the omegahedron superman cousin kara helen slater for use inspiration her art kara uses create bug like thing which immediately crashes through the layer whatever that protects the city the chaos the omegahedron sails out through the opening dooming the argonians death three days time something kara then climbs into pod which zaltar had designed for interdimensional travel and chases after the omegahedron save her world the power source travels directly earth and lands the bowl dip belonging minor league witch named selena faye dunaway who immediately before her dip was ruined announced her desires rule the world her sometimes warlock boyfriend nigel peter cook selena somehow knows that this ball from the sky will help her with her evil plans and she sets out achieve world domination selena unaware course that kara has also arrived earth and that she arrived supergirl complete with appropriate costume supergirl emerges from the bottom lake when she arrives huh why does the omegahedron fall from the sky but supergirl shoots out the bottom lake attention movie explain yourself sorry can only suspend disbelief much can buy into any this nonsense just because the movie wants knowing that she needs secret identity supergirl basically wills herself into school girl outfit complete with different hairstyle picks the alias linda lee and enrolls into school she given her dorm assignment and who happens her roommate lois lane sister lucy coincidence one thing folks but getting really contrived now what follows are some generic all girls school hijinks complete with evil bully girls mean for reason course and even shower scene best moment though comes when supergirl decides put bra over her school uniform and starts stuffing with socks this point rapidly wondering why bothering with this nonsense there some credit give the film however one lengthy and elaborate sequence featuring evil bulldozer destroying small town search its prey very well done also its commendable see genders reversed the film whereas the women have all the power and the men are merely objects and tools hart bochner die hard particularly fun kara love interest lovesick landscaper who under spell cast selena although unfortunately part one the film more ridiculous moments when has rescued from being tapped some menacing bumper cars then there were numerous little things that bothered the flying effects are never convincing for moment all too obvious that helen slater hooked wires instead having her look like she flying the filmmakers wanted her graceful she poses lot and does ballet type maneuvers also who are the first two humans meet supergirl when she arrives earth pair truck drivers rapists who immediately attack her and then meet wacky demise there also some rampant product placement the film most notably for popeye tylenol and root beer with the latter actually putting its logo the shirt one the rapists finally just one word monsters faye dunaway and peter toole ham unmercifully however when toole overacts entertaining and when dunaway does she annoying her character actually says the line seize them one point dunaway henchmen played peter cook and brenda vaccaro fare much better with vaccaro coming off best the equivalent ned beatty otis character from the first two superman movies helen slater effectively portrays supergirl the innocent naive character she written she able gaze flowers and bunnies with the right amount genuine wonder make believable believability aside though still annoying now despite all this negativity and not alone here supergirl not well liked nor well respected movie many circles leave the good people anchor bay entertainment actually make people not only interested but excited about its release dvd they have released two separate editions the film dvd the delight many people including myself yet still unclear why since this movie awful the first and most widely available dvd release features the international version the film which runs minutes longer than the print which ran theaters the movie presented its original theatrical aspect ratio enhanced for 16x9 televisions and has been remastered full thx glory extras the disc include full length audio commentary track with director jeannot szwarc and special project consultant scott michael bosco the excellent minute documentary from 1984 called supergirl the making feature dig that workout montage trailers spots talent bios depth storyboards accompanied score from the movie and assorted still galleries the transfer this international version incredible you think you were watching new release images are sharp colors jump off the screen and the picture free scratches artifacts only some special effects sequences show the wear time and there just isn much that can done about that unless you obsessive like george lucas the new thx approved audio loud and clear all the right places however you hearing absurd dialogue and mediocre jerry goldsmith score which completely unrelated john williams classic superman theme and sounds better suited for cannon films golan globus production the commentary track featuring director szwarc and project consultant bosco step the right direction the evolution audio commentaries bosco seems expert all things supergirl and there with szwarc ensure that there dead air the track bosco probes szwarc for information virtually everyone and everything that comes onscreen and learn great deal more about the film result his participation although times you can tell that bosco looking for specific response from szwarc and surprised when doesn get that response learn some fascinating tidbits the track most notably the almost appearance the film christopher reeve great detail given about superman proposed role the original script before reeve wisely dropped out stands superman written off early the film when hear radio broadcast mention that billions light years away some sort peace mission for the sake brevity won even get into that one szwarc also reveals that was the conscious decision the salkinds and everyone else agreed that supergirl needed stand its own replacing the science fiction the superman films with cutsy whimsical fantasy nonsense bosco also points out scenes not the american release they come along claiming that had they been the original release would have been hit the box office again for the sake brevity won even get into that one anchor bay has also released limited edition only 000 copies pressed two disc set disc one contains everything mentioned for the regular release disc two features the never before seen director cut the film which runs 138 minutes long the additions mainly consist scene extensions which don add much note except for few moments which lengthen peter toole screen time particularly during his latter appearances the print rough spots and the sound only mono but fans the film won care one question though shouldn the director commentary the director cut the film never seen supergirl before sat down watch this dvd was nine when was released theaters and even then was smart enough inform parents not take see when popped the dvd into player and sat down easy chair had idea what expect knew the film wasn beloved and never had any interest before but was willing give shot because the impressive amount work put into the disc the disc began spin was rather impressed with the opening sequence which made sit and wonder assumptions all this time could have been wrong come find out however was just the chase digital stereo logo slunk back into seat the nightmare started the end the film supergirl flies back into the lake with the omegahedron and flies back argo city ugh give surprised even made the end the film not once not twice but three times review these discs supergirl definitely terrific dvd package but very lousy movie

predicament hand doubt exclusive its own country the heartbreaking and solely truthful emotions the characters can easily understood all viewers set modern day iran leila begins the birthday the title character leila hatami after brief prologue which are shown the first encounter between leila and her future husband reza ali mosaffa leila and reza set off visit his parents and then hers where birthday celebration has been planned things seem rosy for the couple the outside but for leila life isn quite sweet earlier that very same day leila had gone see her physician and has ultimately discovered that she holds very little chance ever conceiving child when all the conditions are ruled out and leila passes the possibility adoption reza firmly and lovingly tells her that married her and doesn care all about having children nonetheless leila ashamed that she will never able give him baby which the societal norm and her self esteem not helped all her domineering mother law jamileh sheikhi whose hopes carry the sacred family name vanishes once hearing the news reza her only son bluntly explaining leila that reza has always wished for children and country where polygamy accepted tradition she suggests that take second wife bear child with leila hesitantly agrees and while she and reza are able shallowly laugh afterwards about the hopeful womens inadequacies reza finally does meet woman whom claims like even though refuses through with the marriage leila doesn give her full blessing there are easy answers found within leila film that thoughtfully examines the central character unfortunate plight well the inner workings leila herself told through matter fact narration almost completely taken over her own shame she has option but agree her forceful mother law requests even though she unsure how she will react reza really does end marrying another woman maybe because leila from iran the film will unquestionably shocking for american audiences since the concept polygamy looked upon the characters more less everyday occurrence leila however unable come terms with the idea quite easily but feels her duty make her husband happy matter what the circumstances one the strongest aspects the film its portrayal the relationship between leila and reza who married only three months after their first meeting but obviously love each other very deeply this relationship that the key ingredient making what follows the opening scenes all the more powerful and director mehrjui has succeeded just about well possible although seemingly unimportant first glance early sequence where leila and reza are eating dinner and both are laughing nearly uncontrollably actually one the most vital moments the first half unmistakably sets the boundary for their unrequisite love for one another ditto for another scene which reza gives leila large stuffed animal for her birthday and then reveals beautiful necklace has also gotten her these small moments are the perfect contrast for the solemn outraging sequences the latter half which reza drops leila off the side busy road and then zooms off date with another woman left there ponder her quickly diminishing marriage foolishly unbeknownst reza leila prays each time that the date will not well she will able keep her husband herself for little while longer refusing stay over her parent house the film inevitably leads the second wedding night between reza and another woman and sequence extraordinary sorrow and potency leila finds her whole being emotionally torn apart she closed upstairs bedroom the marriage proceedings are going down below despite her initial agreement such thing leila realizes how much she has been betrayed reza whom she believed cared for her much she did him sure the whole second marriage was his mother idea but really did believe what initially had told her about not wanting any children then could have still easily backed out couldn the pivotal role leila who appears every scene leila hatami nothing short remarkable injecting her character with equal measure startling strength unavoidable vulnerability and utter despair unlike most american films which everything always has spelled out for audiences hatami says much more with just elusive expression her face than could possibly have been conveyed words every bit perfect match for hatami ali mosaffa reza man who believe does hold unbreakable bond with his wife but too naive realize what will doing leila marries someone else for all its strong aspects leila isn perfect film technical level found many blatant punctiation and spelling mistakes within the subtitles that need fixed and concerning the plot developments the final five minutes ring false when compared with everything that has come before mehrjui decision use extremely stylized approach the ending was the wrong choice particularly his almost comedic way wrapping the character the spiteful mother law played memorably jamileh sheikhi despite these minor missteps leila important motion picture that should definately sought out upon its limited may release new york cinema village and then may the thought provoking questions that the film deals with balanced evenly with its uneasy morales and when the climax arrives leila self worth startlingly stripped away reveal victim led into complete devastation which there return difficult not consider how leila culminating interior demise could have been simply avoided had the other characters taken second out their own selfish lives consider what leila the major pawn the

 |text the most interesting part can hardly wait just happens not only the most human but for many the one part that many can easily relate that the character denise lauren ambrose the film sole sarcastic member who mocks everything that goes the film and one point sits down couch and looks totally bored the film wisely holds over this moment nicely showing her alienation the midst large high school party almost too nicely for some members the audience read this basically mirror what going with them watching this film sit there wondering why even bothered see film about long high school party probably never felt the desire the first place would actually highly recommend this film satirized all this after all this film filled with bunch pathetic stereotypes much which went high school with everyone here the jock the homecoming queen the nerd and his dominions trekkies and philes the alienated wannabe writer the school spirit girl the pothead the wigger etc etc etc and weirdly enough this film shows them superficial lame and basically bunch losers except for denise who rolls her eyes everything and easily becomes the most likable character even before she speaks her yearbook entry something which done for each main character quotes oscar wilde definite pointers there unfortunately the writers and directors take several major misteps the way making this into admirable and even likable film the film said portrays most its characters superficial and just totally ignorant everything however instead sticking with this perhaps even going bit further with they let this lie and actually make these characters into our heroes follow several them all bunch moronic stereotypes with only shread humanity and realism and tries tell boring and overly melodramatic tales about them actually cared and identified with them and did certainly don want revisit that state being here quick low down graduation and follow bunch seniors the last night otherwise known the american grafitti lesser extent the dazed and confused cliche the formal just followed them they drove aimlessly the latter did little bit that and featured big outdoor keg party can hardly wait just opts for big indoor keg party and little bit aimless driving albeit the whining because can get girl want brand follow many people around but mostly trail preston ethan embry that thing you the alienated writer who been pining over the homcoming queen amanda the totally overrated jennifer love hewitt for the entirety high school because thinks they shared moment their freshman year over freaking pop tart now that she broken with her football player boyfriend mike peter facinelli decides the party with note written declaring his love for her the hopes build the guts give her even though leaving for multi week intensive writing program hosted none other than kurt vonnegut okay the ingenius vonnegut some icky noxema spokesperson since that plot incredibly lame and track record what goes with wouldn able carry commercial let alone feature film and because party there are some more main characters such william charlie korsmo finally surfacing after dick tracy the nerd and his dominions who has come with ridiculous plan publically sabotage mike who humiliated him for years but gets too caught drinking kenny seth green the wigger who has decided that this party will where will finally get laid huh and denise the only exceptional character who unfortunately gets stuck bathroom don ask with kenny where the two characters let down their characters and are allowed follow the laws plot cliches from point point with nary bit characterization involved after awhile ugh the main comparison this film getting another film actually not american grafitti dazed and confused two films that embraced and ultimately made humans out many its high schoolers not mention were extremely entertaining but john hughes films the 80s most notably sixteen candles the big difference the two that that film managed not only embrace but even satirize its main characters and did equally and entertaining fashion this film forgets satirize its characters and ultimately tells story about bunch uninteresting stereotypes and then says that all okay can take this film seriously nor can take this fun really what good but will tell you some things did like liked the direction except for couple too over the top features like way too glossy jump cuts like oxymoron and other obscurities generally though elfont and kaplan have graceful camera movement and even manage capture altman esque feel their film from time time thing with note though too hokey really admirable actually did like seth green for once about decade when played very young woody allen radio days his desintegration his wigger character was almost believable almost and course lauren ambrose wonderful denise the one character could have used some more even though would have changed the entirety the film however the character denise really doesn work with the film when really thought about she far too witty and realized least for the first half belong this film and whenever she appears she automatically gives everything delightfully satirical tone she not just the cynic the intellectual she just very interesting character who provides entertainment even further damages other already damaged characters she may ruin the film more but least when she screen can sit and think ourselves well least entertained couple other things that just don work mike character who suffers epiphany throughout the film but the end acts though has forgotten everything too much the sacrificial lamb for the film general the aimless bitchy driving preston try and get over his inability shack with amanda give break and perhaps the one thing that just doesn work all jenna eflman uncredited cameo angel just didn work but nice try basically the worst thing about this film the real reason giving this such low rating because refuses give any fully realized characters and then insists follow around complete stereotypes from other movies doing things that are inane and unlike anything don feel for these characters because for most aren stereotypes going through the motions worn subplots the acid test for high school movies does all capture the feel what portraying the answer for this film nice try though

 |text quentin tarantino seems have knack for giving his stars big careers after his pulp fiction many actors began receiving many offers for jobs john travolta made his come back and now one today most bankable stars bruce willis proved his acting chops and now considered actual actor jackie brown the other hand boasts quite well known cast except for the main lead pam grier most likely you have heard her and seen her films but she never really had breakthrough performance her first film was the roger ebert written beyond the valley the dolls that until now jackie brown highly anticipated feature film from quentin tarantino whose last film was the huge hit pulp fiction after mediocre acting jobs tarantino returns what made his name household one directing and writing jackie brown the result and fantastic entertainment despite excellent direction from tarantino the cast steals the film giving one good performance after another pam grier gives stunning performance jackie brown and she supported incredible mix talent samuel jackson bridget fonda michael keaton robert niro and robert forster more than likely you will see few these names the oscar pool come oscar nominations describing quentin tarantino film very difficult you really can say much you spoil for everyone else will tread lightly jackie brown opens with impressive shot jackie brown grier blue outfit walking through the airport the camera tracks along with her and ends revealing her occupation are also introduced ordell robbie jackson who sells illegal guns interested buyers for hefty price brown carries the money from buyer ordell order keep the cops away however fbi agent keaton and local cop michael bowen are out find ordell and catch him while taking the money they try reach him through beaumont livingston chris tucker one ordell buyers but mysteriously ends dead they try again through brown but she hesitant admit any wrong doing but after unknowingly carrying some drugs for one ordell friends fonda she caught and sent jail ordell pays her bail through bail bond agent max cherry forster and then wants find out what she told the cops after she claims have said nothing she reveals the fact that she will tell them about ordell order stay out prison ordell doesn like this but they both come with scheme throw the feds and cops off their track this scheme seems going planned but unexpected occurances may may not foul their goal revealing more would spoil the fun jackie brown and that the biggest reason see tarantino film tarantino seems have fascination with hitmen and unusual predicaments and slang terms but they are always done very well and believably his hitmen are normally cruel but pleasant that nasty sort way they talk like normal people except for when doing business and they are rude their girlfriends course this tarantino film and you know you can expect some awkward situations arise and perhaps the biggest flaw with jackie brown the slow middle section which the pace begins drop course tarantino fixes this moving onto the climax the film adding lot his reservoir dogs style storytelling things are told from one person perspective and then from another and then from another each time learning more and more this all leads very interesting conclusion which decides who whose side the technical side jackie brown quentin tarantino directs with the same style did with his 1994 film however this time around isn nearly impressive original the writing the other hand quite good although find tarantino use slang terms offensive the story jumps back and forth time pulp fiction but much more easy understand his previous film needed second viewing order understand the time differentiation but jackie brown very simply follow especially considering that the time given during the leaps time perhaps this result the screenplay being written from the novel rum punch elmore leonard the dialogue pretty much intelligent and all the characters are fully realized the cinematography very well done guillermo navarro who has worked with tarantino previous films and the editing very good and with pulp fiction the music highlight bringing back memorable songs from the 70s and 80s the acting side jackie brown unforgettable the performances are incredibly rich with hidden meaning behind every characters actions nothing quite seems and you can really tell which side one person the real treat course pam grier who gives astonishing performance jackie brown her poor living conditions are superceded her superior wits which play important role the film watching grieg could tell what was going through her mind even didn know what she was thinking her face portrays lot emotion that you can tell when she sad happy deep thought bridget fonda gives very good performance druggie couch potato didn even realize was fonda until saw her name the final credits her performance actually reminded heather graham boogie nights michael keaton comes across very well does michael bowen chris tucker has small but effective performance samuel jackson very good but seems that was replaying his jules winnfield character from pulp fiction although much less cynical but matter jackson very strong his role robert niro actually little annoying times but overall does good job one ordell perspective clients and friends robert forster gives one the best performances the film has one the most developed characters present throughout most the film and holds his own against jackson and grier jackie brown rated for language sex violence drug use and some offensive remarks film itself jackie brown terrific piece entertainment with complex plot draw viewers however one can not help but compare tarantino pulp fiction and expect great results when compared comes short but not that short worthy effort with terrific acting and some impressive writing from elmore leonard and tarantino perhaps the best thing about jackie brown the discovery pam grier major hollywood actress can remember seeing her anything except for small role mars attacks but hopefully she will get many more roles from this one expect see her name floating around the oscar nominations and hopefully she will even able nab one

 |text natural born killers really very simple story that essence has already been told bonnie clyde with some major variations emphasis mood and degree both films glamorize outlaws one case bank robbers and killers and the other mass murderers both relate the story couple liberated love but where bonnie clyde was partial and subtle natural born killers total and blatant where bonnie clyde was social natural born killers psychological what bonnie clyde hinted natural born killers confronts and explores what bonnie and clyde stole mickey and mallory kill examine natural born killers nothing more than psychological odyssey realization and exposure the frauds surrounding them expressed metaphorically killing subdues the mysterious power this film wields for the most part when mickey and mallory kill they kill all that frustrates them unnecessarily they kill what trying kill them they kill what dissembles and cowers from life they kill what needs killed this mythos least old the hindu trinity brahma created vishnu preserved and siva destroyed but destroyed what needed destroyed make way for the useful creations brahma the following may painfully mundane but metaphorically accurate forced say for clarity sake plumber must remove the old lead and copper pipes that destroy the old plumbing system order replace with the new one made plastics your plumber bonnie and clyde mickey and mallory and siva are all productive destroyers think you could say without much challenge that religion responsible for more killing and death presently and historically than any other phenomena muslims kill christians hindus kill muslims christians kill pagans jews kill christians etc you could reverse subject and predicate each instance and still not challenged religion orgy killing the institution the state only misses first place for technical reasons like hasn been major player for long the two are frequently indistinguishable the state the divine idea upon earth hegel said meaning absolute all powerful ineffable unassailable infallible authoritarian and patriarchal just like jhvh allah god etc well what does all this have with natural born killers let first say that religions this nature the ideal take the place sex consider the catholic church which its hey dey took religion seriously any other religion institution ever god takes the place sex manifested all those vows celibacy taken the pope cardinals bishops monks etc they forego the one order come closer the other during the middle ages when this doctrine was unmitigated and unchallenged the most repressive regime the west has ever known terms scope and magnitude rose power parenthetically witness plato well the republic attempted launch the first systematic absolutist regime not coincidentally was something mystic himself regularly assailing the passions catholicism policy attacks the passions evil sees intercourse only means perpetuate the species not way pleasure masturbation considered sin with the sacrament penance necessary for absolution this religion this authoritarianism its essence further evidence the nazis had the same attitudes the church these matters our culture most the cultures the world have been steeped this tradition for thousands years can help but adopt even internalize some these same authoritarian attitudes leading destructive split between the biological and social self mickey and mallory knox internalized them too then through spontaneous sexual awareness sparked each one them the presence the other discovered them and began expurgating them from themselves and from the world the process unifying themselves straightforward liberation through sex some good patriarch once observed you can maintain control long everyone keeps their clothes had vision what the world would like without contradictions they saw what civilization and culture and everyday life would like under such conditions the moment realization worth thousand prayers mickey says the most consistent and impassioned critic western culture there nietzsche applying his typical stridency the matter let look each other the face are hyberboreans know well enough how remote our place neither land nor water will you find the road the hyberboreans even pindar his day knew that much about beyond the north beyond ice beyond death our life our happiness have discovered that happiness know the way got our knowledge from thousands years the labyrinth who else has found the man today don know either the way out the way whatever doesn know either the way out the way sighs the man today this the sort modernity that made ill sickened lazy peace cowardly compromise the whole virtuous dirtiness the modern yea and nay this tolerance and largeur the heart that forgives everything because understands everything sirocco rather live amid the ice than among modern virtues and other such south winds far can tell this what the movie has say its alleged critique the media only secondary tertiary quaternary subsidiary for sure for example wayne gayle first report ends with some gen dude saying were mass murderer mickey and mallory his most excellent bill and ted voice one level you make the humdrum observation that because the media had glamorized these two psychopaths that the uncritical impressionable gen dumb guy confused the matter and took them for heroes seems more likely that made independent judgement subconscious level recognizing what were and confessing that had the balls honest with himself just like them killing and destroying what deserves let exemplify what been saying analyzing scene from the film namely the scene where mallory fucks the gas station attendant kills him and then castigates him for giving her the worst fuckin head ever had life now never claimed that mickey and mallory had perfect relationship because demonstrably they didn and this scene and the ones leading show this sometimes they are the source each others frustrations but unwilling kill each other since they love each other much and are responsible for each others liberation they must kill place their lever secret that this scene mallory fantasized that her victim was mickey the attendant approached took mickey character the eyes mallory she needed kill him because kidnapped that girl the hotel room and was having secret fantasies about her while making love mallory upon discovery mallory views this betrayal judges him and commutes his sentence someone else the style the movie whole nother matter that won get into very deeply but surely partially responsible for its power let just say that its editing has the opposite effect western with shots that linger forever salon entrance the like suggesting the expansiveness barreness and boredom the frontier lifestyle the rapid succession all those 8mm 16mm 35mm images from various perspectives with soundtrack sometimes sync and sometimes out sink instills skittish frenetic mood also jungian archetypes abound these can help but trigger deep psychological responses can barely understand especially when they flash across the screen for barely few frames some the best scenes and lines that come mind quotes are paraphrased only mickey mallory one these days gonna cummin for you prison while mallory jacks mickey off semen symbol for great potential and things come the time they haven yet had sex nor have they killed anyone yet the two course hand hand for even more explicit semen scene see silence the lambs mickey during his marriage mallory creator universe pronounce man and wife the way woody delivers this line truly haunting but telling too reveals are well their way expunging all their destructive tendencies and replacing them with positive ones this what mickey means creator universe giving himself creating for himself healthy attitudes not necessarily schizophrenic retreat into solipsism first appears scagnetti first meeting with mallory through her pubic hair plucks from the gas station attendant mouth the indian sage releasing mallory father who was reincarnated snake old man snake after telling his snake story that ends with bitch you knew was snake after mickey shoots this sage death during bewildering nightmare mallory says you killed life this another telling quote because implies they didn see themselves killers life then what were they killing that time some case just those zombies faking their way through life the living dead were other cases all the anti life forces the cops and their parents the butterfly just before the movie shifts into the prison course symbolizes rebirth emil reingold portrayed steven wright passing judgement mickey and mallory know the difference between right and wrong they just don give damn this reminiscent nietzsche whole philosophy and maybe direct reference his beyond good and evil mickey the rabbit says the moment realization worth 1000 prayers mickey again his interview and you are not the same species notice when the escape progress get some role reversals terms leadership and control mickey the prisoner becomes the leader his little gang the wardens become prisoners and the civilians like wayne gayle and his producer follow the leader matter who mickey how feelin wayne fucking great mickey you got the feelin wayne alive alive for the first fuckin time what incredible transformation this got the feeling and couldn contain himself what feeling that feeling metaphysical freedom that you can create your own universe mickey when almost caught dead

 |text note some may consider portions the following text spoilers forewarned milos forman first film since the ill fated valmont columbia the people larry flynt vastly entertaining not particularly enlightening biopic hustler publisher and self made millionaire larry flynt who became unlikely champion freedom speech rights the united states the late 1970s and early 1980s the film unweaves its tale chronological order open with young and dirt poor larry flynt and his brother jimmy peddling jars water true entrepreneurial spirit out the rural outback kentucky cut forward time where the two flynt brothers now young men are running the struggling hustler clubs cincinnati the strip clubs are dire financial state and last ditch effort salvage the operations flynt decides print shop and churn out promotional newsletter this evolved into the adult periodical _hustler_ magazine creating larry flynt vast financial empire and the rest history what sets flynt apart from other publishers his struggles against those who would have him cease publication his adult material and who railed and preached against him flynt spent time incarceration and was paralyzed assassination attempt and his driven single minded insistence buck the system and fight for his freedom expression regardless personal cost the people larry flynt also weaves the bittersweet story flynt true love althea leasure whom meets dancer his club and later marries and who devotedly stands alongside him throughout his trials and tribulations considering the serious nature the film theme the importance the united states first amendment the people larry flynt surprisingly and wonderfully light hearted and humourous much the comedy elicited from larry flynt outlandish stunts his courtroom appearances some his chosen apparel hilarious and for the most part these elements the film work far better than some the more dramatic points such uninspiring flynt monologue set free speech rally front enormous american flag dealing with the subjectivity obscenity the film focus the flynt many battles over first amendment rights and freedom speech but the heart the people larry flynt the touching love story between flynt and althea larry flynt shown being occassionally gruff harsh and overtly aggressive with his friends and colleagues but with althea see his loving affectionate side there scene where flynt tenderly takes his ill wife ride his wheelchair that heartbreaking ultimately the emotional power that the film hits its conclusion comes not from his achievements from his battles against censors but from the strength flynt and althea love for each other woody harrelson entirely engaging what must certainly career topping performance the irrepressible larry flynt harrelson plays flynt with the right mixture outrageousness and confident stubborness make him endearing and entirely sympathetic the audience and very compelling protagonist for the film courtney love plays althea leasure startling turn completely raw and impulsive very solid performance brash and naturalistic and love extremely compelling difficult take your eyes off her onscreen and her chemistry with harrelson dead edward norton flynt straight level headed lawyer often upstaged his flashier stars the people larry flynt much his counterpart lawyer alan isaacman was upstaged flynt during many the courtroom scenes but norton shines his big scene where addresses the supreme court the climactic scene the film one can sense the frustration that norton character feels when harrelson free talking flynt sabotages trial after trial him openly speaking his mind and this results heightened emotional punch when norton isaacman has the opportunity sway the supreme court judges milos forman keeps the film moving although runs over two hours never drags and his direction the film very effective eliciting great deal empathy for subject which could construed some extremely sordid and unsympathetic there also great visual technique which forman uses indicate the passing time one shot which both clever and extremely entertaining two minor quibbles with the film certainly seems like the people larry flynt rush get its main theme with flynt battling against authorities and the system for his freedom speech consequently the first thirty minutes the film introducing and setting the characters seem unduly rushed perhaps merely due the fact that these characters are interesting but felt would have worked better this route was taken more leisurely fashion also felt like there was distinctive lack insight into the inner workings these characters the film clearly shows what flynt althea isaacman and rev jerry faldwell did and superficial level some their motivations but never seemed like one could really understand the characters deeper level for example why larry flynt was compelled ruth carter stapleton president carter sister born again mystery then again perhaps was him well these two points don detract greatly from the film the people larry flynt certainly among the very best studio released films 1996 and works both ringing political statement about the importance freedom speech and the depths which larry flynt would advance the cause free expression and touching love story

 |text seen april 1999 crossgates cinema guilderland theater myself for free using hoyts critic pass theater rating very good seats sound and picture you realize that every time you encounter new person you just become part story everyone has their own life story both past and present and every time two more interact they become part each others story not necessarily important even significant part but part nevertheless that seems the basic theory behind where several characters chance encounters all effect each other extreme ways order test this theory screenwriter john august and director doug liman assemble cast characters that wouldn usually the types have entire film revolve around them such teenage supermarket cashier bottom the drug food chain dealer and two struggling soap opera actors these types characters might not sound all that original but consider that they will all somehow effected strip club bouncer and his psychotic father mid level drug dealer narc obsessed with multi level marketing horny wedding guests zen lovemaker two shrimp scarfers and cute normal teenage girl round things out how they will all come together the process the film deals with imagine the concept the film started out the creators testing themselves see they could actually pull off and the outcome terrific achievement filmmaking and the craft fiction general the film starts out anything else with little indication what come meet ronna polley depressed los angeles checkout girl who doesn seem have much desire anything except work just pay her rent she not very charming especially her customers but this played mostly for laughs rather than characterization and works maybe this because she not very afeminite character but she far from masculine creative character indeed things start progress when ronna reluctantly agrees take the hours the goofy hyperactive yet likable simon askew english teen into vices for the sake the experiences this agreement starts three pronged storyline allows simon las vegas for the weekend with his friends and turn drags ronna and her friends into buying and selling experimental drug the process which will not only bring ronna close being arrested but also death nearly the same can said for two other characters zack mohr and adam wolf who don think much when they first appear supporting characters but later will become major players the film makeup another process used the filmmakers elaborate the theory how significant insignificant interaction might once the pace picked the film really begins show its mettle when the title screen ronna flashed shortly after the aforementioned turning point scene clear this film isn going employ the standard linear method storytelling considering how good until that point long overdue change pace needed movies today and the film begins take shape first following ronna and her friends one night adventure that begins with drug deal instigated zack and adam who were actually looking for simon which doesn exactly planned but that what keeps all interesting the second storyline starts the same moment ronna story but this time the camera chooses follow simon instead simon and his three friends head vegas for night the town and the process experience things they never would have imagined the third arc about zack and adam again overlaps with ronna story telling much the same story but from completely different angle shown things never would have expected were going while following ronna and many the events that happen ronna because zack and adam aren even their fault they just happened where they were when they were really like dissect each the three storylines and especially how the film wraps the end but that would take too much time and space and spoil everything for those who haven seen the film perhaps the greatest element the film its constant surprises and unpredictability and not due plot twists confusing screenplay just through great filmmaking still can list and analyze nearly everything the film does well direction trying piece together such complex story easy task and for rookie filmmaker such liman great accomplishment doesn just depict story wraps all pulling into the fray that experience every high and low screenplay besides being chiseled with detail and creative general clear the script has been inspired many sources with both obvious and subtle references yet never screams rip off tone mood where other hollywood films have failed bring the charm the independents the mainstream this one able create its own sense the macabre not overly dark twisted and the comedy isn satirical for considered black comedy more like macabre light cinematography art direction able photograph both the intense and the lighthearted the same manner characterization for nearly every character introduced matter what role they play the big picture able get sense who they are what they thinking and how they came their situations even when their actions are surprising never seems very out synch performances every actor nails their role see above theme theory the film doesn seem concerned with conveying any kind political social messages

 |text many people will not find much like what dreams may come the new film visionary director vincent ward most will come see the computer animated landscapes and vibrant colors but little they know plainly found out that this has quite complex story tell walking out the theater could see the audience disgust one member even had awakened after the film ended don believe the previews that you see this definitely not film for everyone this quite possibly one the most adult oriented films come out recent years kids will get bored with the slow plotting and the complex storyline the plot just fluid the heaven that ward presents goes back and forth time has boundaries think the film city angels now add more complex screenplay and more unique vision both films deal with the afterlife but doubt what dreams may come will well the box office costing around million make the film would have extremely well order make money back but due story doubt will for everyone who thought titanic story was too simple and cliche here proof that james cameron had written more complex screenplay may not have done nearly well but don get wrong hope the film does well vision pure visceral enjoyment that hardly ever gets put the screen doubt most could have thought this place even our own mind what dreams may come the second best film the year when comes visuals the only film that surpasses dark city full rich shocking colors get see heaven that most would probably die get but don that because you end going hell what dreams may come begins with two boats colliding lake chris christy nielsen robin williams startled the sudden jolt but even more startled the beauty the woman the other boat annie annabella sciorra spies chris well and both eventually bond and get married annie artist whose paintings are colorful lush and surrealistic chris doctor and loves annie more than life itself they also have two children marie jessica brooks and ian josh paddock but one day the two children are killed car crash and almost destroys annie she tries commit suicide but fails and then put institution chris copes with the problem realizing they aren around anymore and nothing will change that just annie gets her life back order chris killed while trying save the life car crash victim chris goes heaven his version heaven rather guided albert cuba gooding chris explores his new surroundings with pure delight and joy that until realizes how miserable without annie prior heaven would try comfort annie but the more was around the more pain she felt chris decides leave her alone little does realize what will happen next not about say because the plot point crucial the rest the story many critics however give away certainly chris dying crucial the plot but they tell you that dies the previews story not necessarily important for this movie work because deals with the afterlife however strangely virtually nothing heard god the devil couple comments here and there but the story maintains its focus chris and his search for the love his life soul mates chris exclaims heaven movies almost always depicted glowing city white purity and love usually also looks like rests among the clouds but what dreams may come goes different route shows heaven that most have never seen before chris heaven his memories brought life his thoughts can make anything real and makes the paintings annie drew become his heaven never seen anyone use real paint before albert says equally good the depictions hell which cast away the normal stereotypes fire and brimstone instead state being one gloriously horrific scene chris and his tracker max von sydow arrive sea faces thousands heads are stuck above ground their bodies somewhere else mostly dead silent some quips are made almost lighten the mood truly frightening sequence production designer eugenio zanetti definitely going for oscar nomination using state the art computer technology worlds are created for exploration sometimes some scenes play out they are only there for the visual impact not necessary there but appreciate seeing costume designer yvonne blake who also appears the film has done incredible job providing some interesting and colorful costumes cinematographer eduardo serra whose work was last seen the luscious wings the dove has difficult job most cinematographers working with special effects but serra entire universe computer generated image and does masterful job writer ron bass adapting from the novel richard matheson provides very fluid screenplay with real set plot the story extremely vague its details allowing viewers think for themselves about the meaning and director vincent ward puts all together into his final vision what dreams may come good example german expressionism which may just turn off good portion the audience your average movie goer more than likely isn used expressionistic techniques the film will also definitely draw attention from religious people but they shouldn take too far after all just movie robin williams has continuously impressed with his dramatic performances while his comedic roles have been suffering his comedy perfection when makes his own stuff but when confined screenplay isn quite effective but drama really his strong point and you can see that here doubtful get another oscar nomination but wouldn really mind did the real surprise here annabella sciorra who impressed last year with cop land this may her breakout role and may garner her some much needed attention also quite possible that she could get oscar nomination however the academy doesn like award performances for these types films cuba gooding has been better but certainly not distracting max von sydow underused are jessica brooks and josh paddock treat for some movie goers see werner herzog appear they even recognize him chris father lost the sea faces not hard see why herzog would attracted this film considering thinks that audiences are starving for great images overall williams and sciorra film what dreams may come rated for thematic elements involving death some disturbing images language and some partial nudity the film definitely aimed more adult audience some will find the plot distracting some will find the visuals absolutely glorious and some will find both the only real problem with the film that could see was that slows down considerably during the midsection just after have been immersed the visuals and before the search for annie begins the way some controversy even surrounded the title which was mistaken for sexual term what becomes wet and you should understand actuality the title from soliloquy hamlet just thought should let you know

 |text the above dialogue from this film taken almost completely context and not jazzed bit make more inept than spoken between two the protagonists somewhere the film and basically serves perfect example what this film about especially you realize that this exchange meant taken seriously gregg having mid life crisis araki the writer and director this film wants show how important teenagers are and wants show how they feel such horrible horrible world and how does show really cheap surrealism and moronic exchanges like this and gets better similar bit dialogue said the middle dunno the fiftieth sex scene this film not counting the several masturbation scenes one the protagonists humping away top another and says her something along the lines you ever wonder what life all about sorry man foreplay takes place before the act coitus course what you expect the film was written and directed guy who can even spell his first name right yes know cheap joke but had done the doom generation advertised road trip movie about people who around killing others who attack them and also another teen angst film one the slogans teen four letter word hardy har har film about two angsty teens amy blue rose macgowan who would later play the buxom tatum scream and jordon white james duval who would play randy quaid son independence day who pick angsty homicidal maniac xavier red jonathan schaech who would play the angsty lead guitarist that thing you and the way you get the symbolism red white and blue huh huh and road trip where three things happen order they have sex they run into weird people they kill them the film basically remix bunch other far superior films gregg araki obviously has seen such films easy rider natural born killers and kalifornia and tries borrow elements from all these films and make something which like pop culture reference guide but what forgets these films either represented something that this film does not that they dug deep into their subjects and brought something out them make them deeper the doom generation doesn want this just wants show everything surreal manner for the sole reason that araki does not want deal with them any kind real level wants show everything weird manner and forgets what the scenes are supposed about here one scene earlier scene the film amy and jordan into quick mart type place get food and other stuff amy smoking and the clerk asian man mind you love how racist this film really tells her put out she tells him fuck off something that note points shotgun her and she puts out reluctantly jordan makes two hot dogs and takes them the counter the cash register rings and this symbolism doesn stop here jordan checks for his wallet but really the car asks amy for but she left her wallet the car well the clerk brings out his shotgun again and asks for the money they say they don have gets ready kill them but then xavier who they ditched the middle nowhere scene before pops out nowhere fights with the clerk and ends with him blowing the clerk head clean off clean wound mind you the head shown flying through the air and lands fryer where begins scream don really object this kind sick violence but this scene the film for one reason and one reason only gross you out araki thinks that takes everything the extreme make some kind art wrong takes kind resistance make gore art when george romero made dawn the dead very gory flick even for today had control over everything and still was able make everything sick same goes for peter jackson disgustingly gory dead alive which features minute long fest blood guts dismemberments flesh chewing and other assorted stuff all ending with guy with lawn mower strapped his body taking out all sorts zombies was sick but was also satirical and controled scene like this has purpose the film and sticks out from everything else that happens here couple other scenes jordan and amy have sex bath tub and xavier watches masturbates and then licks the semen from his hand xavier and amy have sex and jordan watches from the window masturbates and falls backwards man attacks the trio and stabbed the crotch giant sword put there just this could happen fast food employee stalks the trio and his arm shot off xavier and various other annoyances also look for about million camoes from wide assortment people who probably didn really know what they were getting into when they signed just like peter toole helen mirren malcolm macdowell and john gielgud probably didn when they signed caligula people such indie actors parker posey and nicky katt alternative rock stars skinny puppy and perry farrel hollywood madam heidi fleiss christopher peter brady mcknight amanda bearse and margaret cho all grace the screen for matter seconds then disappear that can return the annoying main plot line why are they here that can all point them and say hey look fill the blank wow gimme break the film meaning pretty easy detect that you know teens are precious and the world such horrible place that when the two entities collide there giant explosion horrific violence otherwise defined teen angst the belief that being teenager horrible thing and that the world too bad for you look years old went through very brief teen angst thing which curiously lasted about long taste nirvana did since moved don really know what with life phase but the teen angst phase something which annoyingly sophomoric and ignorant that any film that thinks they dealing with any kind serious level just beating the wrong horse part being teen experimenting and testing the waters not whining about how awful parents are and purposely feeling dispondent this what the characters this film and the film wants show how they these great people who are being punished the world because they teenagers and how they try defend themselves but can totally overcome them not their fault they kill people the world what they really need reality check the world bad place and teenagers can easily harmed because they are experimenting but part taking everything that happens you and learning from the film thinks that teenagers are basically doomed and there nothing they can about hence the title not only does have bad fallacy but can even express this intelligent and coherent manner everything overly surreal and all get are scenes graphic violence and graphic sex how does xavier licking semen off his hand express teen angst how does talking decapitated head show that teens are dispondent because the world makes them this way and why does the film constantly back the teen angst issue the film araki had any kind competence writing direction show them for what they really are and didn want the satirical approach show the real problems with the world and you still don think that the doom generation incompetent every single possible level could take the acting rose macgowan horrible yes she proved herself talented scream but she bad the doom generation that had not seen her scream would have christened her one the worst actresses working films today her entire performance one note bitchy and the one scene where she cries over dead animal forced that laughable equally bad jonathan schaech who wants the slacker serial killer someone who doesn have any remorse because emotions cause some kind strain his performance annoying hell and granted was better that thing you and then there james duval let just say makes keanu reeves look like brando has the same kind slacker stuttering only much much much worse and every line says bad that have now deemed him least talented actor the world have seen lots bad actors but james duval has got the worst least somewhere there here another example bad scene you still not convinced the film opens club where they playing nine inch nail most banal song heresy example the lines god dead and one cares there hell see you there and the song plays and red strobe lights show the patrons dancing the film pans over amy just standing there looking dispondent the film closes her she looks right the camera and says fuck explanation this should necessary and finally note gregg grow really move out your parent basement read something other than salinger and get day job and don quit

terrorist groups throughout the film maintains conflict between hubbard who wants use the fbi pursue the terrorists within the letter the law and general devereaux bruce willis who command the army and the mind that the greater good would better served suspending the law and pursuing the terrorists more forcefully what results fascinating debate over the appropriateness and constitutionality the declaration martial law and the invocation the war powers act utilizing philosophy and historical examples make points both sides actually gets rather heady times but credit screenwriters zwick lawrence wright and menno meyjes that they don underestimate the intelligence the audience don know his tone inflection something else but denzel washington has way spitting out dialog that makes whatever says sound great this combined with his innate acting ability and his experience playing the mid level authority figure makes his performance the siege convincing and enjoyable annette bening gives one the more assertive portrayals female character seen recently and the chemistry she shares with washington palpable somewhat unfortunate that her character fortitude broken certain point but allows watch bening play little more range bruce willis pretty much relegated tough guy role always standing straight and with permanent scowl fixed upon his face however the tension that exists between devereaux and hubbard major drive behind the film development notable tony shalhoub who plays fbi agent frank haddad lebanese immigrant the role calls for evidencing both kind filial pride for his heritage and contempt for those his own race who might interfere with his integration into the american society difficult say the least shalhoub does with naturalness you can almost reach out and touch perhaps best known for his role antonio the cab driver the nbc sitcom wings shalhoub gained notoriety for his dramatic abilities the wonderful film big night whereas denzel washington seems edward zwick favorite actor directed washington glory and courage under fire james horner seems his favorite composer therefore found odd that zwick chose the prolific score writer graeme revell seven films this year already over horner for the siege until realized that this film contained lot arabian themed music and horner record has shown more propensity for scores either neutral ethnicity irish sounding most revell does good job providing appropriate music punctuate key scenes and allowing the score enhance the movie whole nowhere near intrusive some the other films been getting throughout the year missteps the siege can found couple the excesses takes for example pretty clear throughout that the film meant more thriller than action flick unfortunately there scene where the army just cuts loose against some arab immigrants blatant display firepower and explosions obviously meant for the sole purpose being eye catching the middle the city and against real opposition zwick even has the army use cobra attack helicopter shoot rockets into building farther than feet from friendly troops verisimilitude really goes out the window that point the film also gets little preachy toward the end focusing the ability different races get along noble gesture the film just puts the message across bit too obviously these flaws are glaring but they don detract too much from otherwise good film that makes you think about issues you may not have considered since history class
 |text martial arts master steven seagal not mention director has built career out playing allegedly fictitious martial arts superman who never gets hurt fights talks hushed tone and squints any sign danger also the most consistent individual hollywood today since all his movies suck they basically represent his egotisitical tendencies about his art that martial art sure the guy good and seems like nice guy talk shows although tad haughty but these movies makes are all the same guy who basically indestructable maybe wounded supposedly mortally then comes back with vengeance and goes buddha all the baddies asses although kinda liked under siege course this one change has message that drilled into our mind course after blows lot stuff and kills bunch people why watch his crap usually don will never and you can hold this will never pay see this man movies unless and only unless supporting role executive decision and definitely pay dies executive decision but this one has special place heart this doesn mean good that even liked this was the last movie watched with deceased uncle and had one hell time ripping apart mystery science theatre 3000 and this was couple years before had heard mystery science theatre 3000 this one seagal plays worker for mining factory set alaska and run the greased typical shallow villain this time played oscar winner give the movie some more clout michael caine seems that caine wants something with his oil factory that includes him dumping oil all over inuit land around the minute point seagal speaks him what seems the typical speech all the vain entrepeneurs what with his new fire down below another message film and caine has him bumped off does seagal rescued some inuits and falls love with one them played joan chen who can act hypothetically but for some reason not here one caine cliched henchmen played here with lot overacting john mcginley shoots the cheif the inuit clan and chen and seagal voyage take down the oil factory literally course one point seagal gives wonderfully hysterical speech about how doesn have any options but blow stuff even goes far say don want kill someone and the same breath asks some guy where the arsenal have problem with violence huge john woo fan but paints his films with suspense skill style depth characterization and just plain cool violence the films seagal the suspense mainly consists the baddie attacking him stupidly and him either wounding killing them some points they use the cliche the talking villain where the villain has the advantage can shoot seagal but begins talking either telling him his big secret plan saying corny line which seagal says something hokey back and has had enough time devise way away with them and does this would okay there were any suspense didn take itself seriously all like the case this summer con air but seagal serious about his skill and course his message wouldn mind this was message film the way that they present you with evidence but seagal has idea how present film where the message subtle not pounded into the viewer mind the villain totally shallow and cartoonish thus can take him and his motives seriously and while seagal talks about being kind the environment also goes ahead and blows square mile rig and kills some workers who were just doing his job then the end spends good minutes giving speech just case you didn get the message from the trailers what seagal doesn realize that one takes his films seriously although maybe couple and any message has only redundant but doesn comfortably fit his film which filled the brim with hokey violence crap suspense stupid melodrama and characters who have about much emotional depth petri dish far seagal and his acting rather boring squints kills period nothing else yeah there corny one liners gonna reach out and touch someone course the star and supposed root for him and all makes all the villains unbelievably stupid and bunch jerks michael caine who great actor just supposed yell and look cold does well guess but this alfie coure one was expecting that caliber performance from him his big henchman john mcginley kinda boring well but not horrible and even get small performance from that god drill sergeants celluloid lee ermey from full metal jacket hired assasin squad leader who gets say the obligatory speech about how dangerous seagal just for the movie trailers and for seagal ego and also look for billy bob thornton one ermey assasins anyway conclude this all judge one seagal movies judge all them except for under siege and executive decision though the latter not really seagal movie they all have this same formula they all have the same action same villain same plot but this one has that message which makes more excrucitating watch mean you rent and don reccomend you make sure you just skip the last minutes but have put seagal for creating film bad that the last film viewed with uncle was pleasurable one extra star for the fun watch and mock

 |text when pair films from the same director gets released just three weeks apart could mean one two things that the recently overworked individual due for well deserved rest that either these movies has been sitting studio safe for while and the timing merely coincidence the latter the case with john mctiernan and the thirteenth warrior which finally hits theatres year and counting after its original spring opening and fast the heels mctiernan the thomas crown affair remake flick that got good reviews you don have believe superstitions wager guess that thirteenth won lucky reportedly shelved following skirmishes between mctiernan and producer michael crichton whose eaters the dead novel provides warrior source and its initial title this messy melange culture clash drama and brutal warfare feels empty and sluggish sorta like braveheart without any the passion but the bloodshed certainly remains there enough carnage display here satisfy those search purely visceral thrills though please note that the admittedly pungent battle sequences containing all this death and dismemberment alternate with talky passages interminable their dullness these circa 10th century clashes involve roving band cannibalistic creatures capable decapitating opponents with their bare hands and dozen norse soldiers out stop them from terrorizing the viking countryside the good guys are loud crude often unintelligible and judging from their highly icky hygiene habits pretty smelly boot which makes them perfect foils for the dignified arab ambassador antonio banderas who tags along quite reluctantly they also hard tell apart that hardly matters when few them meet violent demises you wince you groan you grouse haven seen this guy killed twice before banderas stands confused amidst the chaos partaking mostly from distance savages darth maul facepaint and draped the latest animal skin fashion run amok not the hero his soulful eyes and lean build don exactly herald champion shwarzenegger proportions and the thirteenth warrior wisely doesn pretend allowing his foreign and physically imposing stars step into the spotlight when the going gets rough let the characters interaction sans swords and shields however and there still struggle for the audience follow even care about the story isn the end until audiences have witnessed half baked romance murky political intrigue veteran actor omar sharif funny girl dropping cameo role and climactic indiana jones and the temple doom esque chase through the villains underground lair all this clutter receives stunning visual treatment courtesy cinematographer peter menzies but the collaboration between die hard helmer mctiernan and jurrasic park creator crichton should have yielded more than sumptuous sights graphic action and unintentionally telling moments heard during the thirteenth warrior final scene dog whimpering how appropriate
 |text any movie that kills emilio estevez off the first fifteen minutes has something going for unfortunately this and the familiar theme music are the only worthwhile things about mission impossible directed brian depalma the first problem that this film has absolutely connection with the show whatsoever aside from the music the show was about impossible mission force whose deft teamwork orchestrated jim phelps allowed them counfound evil dictators mythic banana republics from inflicting their sordid schemes upon the world teamwork was the key this film set cross between james bond and depalma blow out where the john travolta character was the victim real and imagined conspiracies from all directions was travolta vulnerability that made that film exciting and claustrophobic this film tom cruise basically omniscient believe that and there fun going here whatsoever the story about contrived contrived gets and full holes there are basically two memorable sequences one involves breaking into kubrickesque computer room task that could have been made much easier had the characters whit common sense suffice say that the alarm system disengaged when the computer operator the room the second involves high speed train helicopter and the chunnel and does not have seen disbelieved the actors are all miscast especially emannuelle beart jim phelps wife who cannot act and ving rhames computer hacker who looks lost and embarrased this movie tom cruise james bond and jon voight looks more like bobby the brain heenan than jim phelps brian depalma career has been bafflingly erratic his best beats hitchcock his own game blow out carrie body double but this not his best the screenplay was partly written robert towne who wrote the best scenario the seventies chinatown but this script perfunctory best and terrrible worst the cinematography has comic book red blue emphasis which nice look but the suspense sequences are all telegraphed and this movie even features the old killer who talks too much before shooting thus giving the victim time think escape trick please don spend your money this only encourage hollywood make more
