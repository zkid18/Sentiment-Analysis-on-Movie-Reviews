and this year hercules successively proving less and less potent with the once seemingly impregnable disney stranglehold the market share suddenly looking mighty vulnerable and faced with their first serious competition the animated film market from fox anastasia disney has brought xmas home early dusting off the feature which sparked the modern revival feature animation the little mermaid while the animation for the film typically the case for disney films unquestionably top notch the magic the little mermaid not its animation but the wonderful innocence its story and its rousingly superb music the film storyline fairly straightforward young teen falls for handsome man father disapproves and assigns hapless chaperone his daughter teen disobeys father and goes desperate lengths win her man except this case the chaperone crab the teen young mermaid and the object her desire human prince what makes the little mermaid affecting and emotionally resonant the richness and charm its characters and the sheer clarity and honest simplicity their emotions from the moment mermaid ariel lays her eyes prince eric she resolutely smitten and she such pure and endearing character that one can help but invest their heart with her this simple but touching love story coupled with healthy dose smart humour makes the little mermaid remarkably captivating picture one the interesting things about the little mermaid something which now curiously dates the voices cast for its motley crew characters this film was produced just before the distracting concept using celebrity voices became vogue which started certain degree with beauty and the beast and was irrevocably exacerbated robin williams much heralded turn aladdin the release the lion king and henceforth the majority characters

ashman lyrics who had created little shop horrors and would compose beauty and the beast and aladdin for disney before ashman untimely death not only are menken tunes unbearably catchy but ashman charming lyrics are fully integrated into the film storyline that the songs are virtual extension the character dialogue and consequently work wonderfully within the context the film menken score for

1 |text december 1996 little movie called scream was released became box office smash and resurrected films targeted teens first was teen slasher movies that were the big fad both scream movies know what you did last summer urban legend etc but just recently the popularity has switched over the teen comedy genre 80s john hughes starting with last june can hardly wait may the first week april 1999 but far this year have been given movie aimed the and under market almost every single week varsity blues jawbreaker cruel intentions simply irresistible the rage carrie and the mod squad coming april are two more this type never been kissed and and april got the teen satire election and the teen horror comedy idle hands jeesh out all these moves however the one that most similar the latest incarnation things hate about you this past january mediocre hum she all that although similar plotting darn near identical things hate about you modern day version shakespeare the taming the shrew she all that got its inspiration from pygmalion infinitely superior film every department from the smart direction first time feature director gil junger the charming and well written screenplay karen mccullah lutz and kirsten smith the striking ensemble cast who give the best group performances teen comedy since 1985 the breakfast club and top all off the inevitable climax set the prom least didn have once again suffer through goofy inappropriate dance sequence who could forget want remember for that matter this ludicrous development she all that the day wide eyed shy new student cameron james joseph gordon levitt starts school seattle based padua high swept away the sight the beautiful and popular sophomore bianca stratford larisa oleynik although doesn know french purposefully learns some just can tutor her but finds that her paranoid gynecologist father larry miller won allow her date until her bitter unconventional older sister kat julia stiles senior decides kat course has sworn off the likes boys but cameron sets out find someone that will the perfect match for her which exactly what finds the form the rebellious patrick verona heath ledger complicating matters cameron dorky friend michael david krumholtz decides use wealthy jock joey andrew keegan who also has his sights set bianca pawn that will pay patrick get kat out with him and then cameron hopes steal bianca away from joey you can see things hate about you includes huge number characters some which haven even mentioned such kat shakespeare obsessed friend mandella susan may pratt and bianca materialistic comrade chastity gabrielle union short but well used running time minutes all the characters are perfectly handled satisfyingly developed and for the most part are not treated caricatures another flaw she all that where the bad guys and gals ran around constantly saying you vapor since could sympathize with the realistic depictions the central characters and since many the comedic and dramatic scenes were surprisingly effective got completely caught all the relationships and was thoroughly entertained aside from good screenplay the performances that can make break movie and director junger has really hit the jackpot aside from joseph gordon levitt 3rd rock from the sun who gives his strongest performance date here none the actors are that well known but this aspect that brings particular freshness the proceedings the main character kat julia stiles last seen the miniseries the 60s marvelous and always believable and certainly has bright future ahead her even though her role that initially the most difficult and hard edged was easy identify with kat way thinking she against the silly tradition the prom and loves reading sylvia plath and completely admired her individuality one think could have portrayed her perfectly stiles does heath ledger the infamous bad boy the town injects much life into patrick and has lot chemistry with stiles one other actor note larisa oleynik who with the help screenwriters lutz and smith able turn bianca into person with multi dimensions even though she accurately self centered the set one truthful scene cameron angrily asks her she has always been selfish and bianca grudgingly realizes that yes she has one off beat element the film and source some hearty laughs the way that the school staff act which strikingly unformal allison janney the guidance counselor perky who writing trashy harlequin romance novel comic dynamite daryl chill mitchell the english teacher who reads shakespeare the class rap and one point sends kat the office because for once she actually thinks one his assignments really good although there are few cheap laughs that are thrown into the film near the beginning most actually works especially the humorous and witty dialogue exchanges and quirks between the characters one very funny scene chastity asks know people can overwhelmed and they can underwhelmed but can people just whelmed another point bianca and kat father stand out larry miller who constantly terrified that his daughters are going get pregnant only allows bianca the prom one occasion before she leaves she has put the heavy fat suit has she will get idea what like pregnant things hate about you once and for all proves that there still life the teen comedy genre and this movie probably more reminiscent the great john hughes than any other film the 90s also helps that the movie has perfectly assembled soundtrack mixing indie rock with new wave 80s songs and with thank goodness rap the film end actually had rooting for certain characters get together and was also quite pleased with how everything was wrapped especially the final scenes involving kat and bianca kat and her father and flawlessly acted and moving sequence which kat gets read the poem she has written for her english class this where the title comes from luckily doubt would able find ten things hate about things hate about you but the positive aspects the film far out number ten
-1 |text the last line near that honor the great butler alfred the ubergod michael gough saying think need bigger bat cave something that note that exactly what this film too big for its own good because has too damn much cut batgirl out cut one the villains too much handle one dosage much that characters get left behind poor elle gets mere scenes and subplot which introduced but never finished any way shape form and elle deserves better this the fourth the gigantic film series and the second from director joel schumacher also the fourth worst the series and second worst from joel the series has been declining since its stunning debut followed the almost stunning sequel and then the anti climactic third one first joel this one not anti climactic knew was gonna suck joel make fun though batman forever was fun this big bore over produced action sequences and shallow characters mean this one bit gonna put all the plot one paragraph freeze nold who wife was dying some disease has become the new big villain these days huge scientist who fell into some weird liquid hello joker and now has body temperature big fat zero and has blue body batman george and robin chris fight him bit but find they growing apart meanwhile another villain shows poison ivy uma who was dorky scientist chick working flowers south america with twistet scientist john glover who kills her when she finds out used her research develop uberman bane who basically man pumped with chemicals which probably killed any personality ever had she emerges from her chemicals don ask cause can tell sexy woman the real uma who poison when you kiss her and has some aphrodiasiatic scent she blows people she starts tear away the dynamic duo meanwhile alfred dying the same disease freeze wife has but earlier state than she and his niece barbara alicia comes all the way from oxford without english accent get him away from the butler trade but soon well not really soon takes her hours becomes batgirl meanwhile unfinished subplot bruce batman alter ego you forgot has been dating the lovely julie madison the even lovlier elle macpherson who wants commitment after year but says nothing end her for all know freeze ultimately teams with poison ivy and they want freeze the world and then take over growing new plants their population don ask the trio must team together family beat them there not the whole story but big context clues too much right right the films seems patched together nice little ideas which would have made for couple good sequels however while tim burton nicely balanced the villain batman storyline although not wonderfully joel seems almost nothing with batman this one gets some corny speeches couple clever lines and that maybe some stunts for all this can even comment george clooney batman hardly saw the guy and when did had horrible dialogue say think michael keaton the quintessential batman but val kilmer was too robotic and fake batman the last episode george between them not quintessential not horrible good but sure next time when they decide renovate the series since they critically murdered for this sorry effort get good script and clooney will shine still has the job the villains are the only interesting part the series according schumacher last time had the brawn two face played tommy lee jones and the brains comedy supplied the riddler realized jim carrey this time have somewhat sympathetic and somewhat hatable villain the same guy freeze feel bad for his mental physical collapse but does really need kill everyone for plants arnold isn very good too hokey but kinda sympathetic some points when watches old movies his wife actually looks somber wow but uma makes the most her seductive character getting the right point between hamminess and seductiveness like she almost parodying herself pulp fiction points she incredibly hot and makes the movie pretty much star better for the lower bat people chris the same was batman forever although think his work these too hokey when best quieter parts scent woman just plain cool parts fried green tomotoes alicia love the girl but she not particularly good this film she can hypotheitically act all saw that clueless but her lines kinda sound weird and isn the mushy mouth this time but all fairness she has virtually part joel gets around her occasionally and when she she does stupid stuff although know not the only one who loved the catfight between her and uma and poor elle poor poor elle love that woman and she can also hypothetically act for those who saw sirens but she has part seems like joel had much footage that had edit almost hour out the final product there are couch scenes like best friend noticed now listen this one every batman flick there couch scene the original was with vicki returns was good make out scene with selena and the last one was chat with nicole this one nothing and batgirl does next nothing this film till the end when she suddenly part the family fortunately get lot alfred the always reliable butler case you didn know who has been with bruce all his life god father figure also dying this got love alfred almost much bruce and see him robe not his tux and freaking dying just gets also get the idea that might have been unhappy the whole time but this never answered this film too cluttered but defense does have some good parts other than uma for one george good batman but unfortunately gets nothing and there are some nice touches when they show the asylum one point they show the patient belongings room and see the riddler costume laughed and during biker scene involving robin and batgirl another subplot never handled past initiation period not only see coolio but bunch bad asses dressed droogs from clockwork orange laughed all these the film falls apart around the five minute mark during enormously long action sequence which must last around minutes did just feel like that the film should serve another the long line films which demonstrate that need more intelligent films nowadays people are fed with stupid films that why the word mouth killed the lost world that why last year indy films grossed more than ever that why this will have strong box office initative from people who just want see like but will die after week two when the word around the grapevine kills that why the next two big budget aciton pics are john woo face off and barry sonnenfeld men black both which are the first two catch the wave early like joel schumacher more person than artiste like some his films flatliners time kill but lot them suck really eccentric person and loved one his quotes about how admits being mediocre director and that what makes him great but his costuming for woody allen sleeper was more interesting than this one and his costuming was cool look for the nazi number love the batman series the first two rocked and did like the last one but this one not going one that watch repeatedly like the other three hopefully this will also serve springboard better batman next time and maybe they get smart and bring back catwoman and michael keaton but can only hope

copyright 1999 nathaniel atcheson fellow critic once stated his belief that reviewer should not speak himself his own review attempted obey this rule recent months but would impossible this case the fact nearly every person who goes see the phantom menace brings baggage with them the original star wars trilogy means much many people for they calibrated creativity child they are masterful original works art that mix moving stories with what were astonishing special effects the time and they still hold pretty darn well too young have seen star wars the theater during its original release but that doesn make any less dedicated the contrary the star wars trilogy and the empire strikes back particular are three items very short list why love movies when heard that george lucas would making the first trilogy the nine film series got exited when first saw screenshots from the film well over year ago embarked year long drool anticipation and when the first previews were released last thanksgiving was ready see the film but then there was the hype the insane marketing campaign and lucasfilm secretive snobbery over the picture the last weeks before the picture opened while multitudes fans waited outside theaters and stood the boiling sun days advance just the first ones the theater was tired hearing about was tired seeing cardboard cut outs the characters whenever went kfc taco bell just wanted see the movie reader not misunderstand did not have anti hype reaction the hype was unavoidable understand and accept the hype just what happens when the prequel the most widely beloved films all time get released five minutes into the phantom menace knew there was problem who are these jedi knights asked why are they churning out stale dialogue with machine gun rapidity why aren these characters being developed before their adventures why there special effects shot nearly every frame the entire film these were just some questions early later asked where the magic the first three films and why looking watch every fifteen minutes the end the film was tired maddened and depressed george lucas has funneled his own wonderful movies into pointless mindless summer blockbuster the phantom menace star wars film take away the title and the jedi talk and the force and you left with what easily one the most vacuous special effects movies all time embarrassment looked desperately for scene which character explored new theme examined special effects shot isn used there are few each but they all token attempts the fact george lucas has created what simultaneously abysmally bad excuse for movie and pretty good showcase for digital effects this not what wanted see didn want leave the phantom menace with headache and bitter taste mouth but did the story centers mostly around qui gon jinn liam neeson looking lost and confused and his apprentice obi wan kenobi ewan mcgregor who scarcely has line the film and their attempts liberate the people the planet naboo naboo the victim bureaucratic war with the trade federation their contact naboo queen amidala natalie portman the teenage ruler who truly cares for her people after picking jar jar binks completely cgi character voiced ahmed best they head tatooine where they meet young anakin skywalker jake lloyd and his mother pernilla august qui gon knows that the force strong with young anakin and the jedi knights take the boy with them their journeys the bad guys are darth maul and darth sidious neither whom have enough lines register characters there isn anything particularly wrong with this story when looking synopsis form the way lucas has handled however unsatisfactory first all don learn one single thing about qui gon jinn not one thing what was his life like before this film well imagine didn have one that why feels like plot device this probably explains why neeson looks hopeless the role and why recently retired from film don blame him honestly obi wan character was really looking forward learning more about even less interesting mcgregor has just few lines anyone hoping see the engaging young actor great performance urged look elsewhere since these two men are the focus the phantom menace lucas has served big emotional void the centerpiece his movie things start pick when our characters reach tatooine young anakin perhaps the only truly fleshed out character the film and lloyd does thoughtful job with the role was also hugely impressed with the sand speeder scene rarely action sequence fast and exciting and when anakin says goodbye his mother found moving also fairly good portman and she manages give little depth character where depth has been written jar jar binks one the most annoying characters ever had endure but more interesting than most the humans soon the relatively brief segment tatooine over back the mind numbing special effects and depthless action scenes seen many movies that qualify special effects extravaganzas but the phantom menace the first one seen that had sick the special effects fifteen minutes into the movie the reason obvious george lucas has restraint can say that didn find the effects original because did the final battle between darth maul obi wan and qui gon visually exceptional most the film but also found the effects deadening and tiresome breaking point was near the end the picture anakin getting questioned yoda and the other jedi masters the background see hundreds digital spaceships flying around through digital sky and wanted that away can have one stinking scene that isn bursting the seems with special effects shot got sick looking the cgi characters and spaceships and planets and backgrounds that really just wanted outside and look physical landscape for few hours and then there the question magic what was lost the sixteen years between the phantom menace and return the jedi have feeling that lucas was focused how his movie looked that forgot entirely the way should feel john williams familiar score help nor lucas direction think comes right down characters there are none here longed for the magnetic presence han luke and leia but got such thing and what about the ridiculous expectations mine weren that high simply wanted film that showed the roots the films that grew loving story that had few characters and few great special effects instead got two hours and fifteen minutes lifeless and imaginative computer graphics show don hate the phantom menace much resent like forget that exists and yet can here stay can only hope that episodes and iii have something substance them because they don then lucas will have pulled off the impossible task destroying his own indestructible series

1 |text star wars episode the phantom menace 1999 review matt pusateri few movies evoke nostalgia enthusiasm and affection like george lucas 1977 classic star wars the original blockbuster film and its two sequels not only evoked wonder and passion generation filmgoers but has deeply entrenched itself american pop culture arguably more americans today can explain what the force jedi than budget deficit serb years after the release the original and years since the third film the return the jedi how can any new star wars film withstand the weight incomparable expectations and anticipation can new storyline and new cast characters possibly compete with the legends the first trilogy luke han solo and darth vader all cultural icons against this challenge the fourth star wars film episode one the phantom menace hit the screens last week and despite some early critical reviews the major media the film neither flop nor disappointment while the phantom menace certainly not the finest film the series nonetheless engaging exciting and visually breathtaking worthy sequel prequel the original star wars films the phantom menace takes place decades before the setting original films the film opens obi wan kenobi ewan mcgregor the wise old master who introduced luke the force the original star wars only young jedi apprentice still learning from his fellow jedi and instructor qui gon jinn liam neeson the republic government has sent the two jedi settle trade dispute that has developed into blockade the planet naboo shifty trade federation the jedi quickly find themselves not negotiations but the middle planetary invasion rushing protect naboo young queen amidala natalie portman later after eventually rescuing amidala and helping her escape naboo they are forced stop tatooine repair their battle damaged ship before bringing her the galactic senate make appeal for justice tatooine qui gon discovers young slave boy anakin skywalker jake lloyd who not only can help them get the parts they need but displays uncanny intelligence insight and instincts qui gon senses the child unusually strong with the force and begins suspect that may the one prophesized bring balance the force anyone who has watched the original star wars trilogy knows far from being galactic savior the innocent looking year old will time become the ruthless darth vader complicating matters further mysterious hooded figure darth sidious behind the trade blockade and invasion naboo and sends out lethal apprentice darth maul find and capture queen amidala while amidala and the jedi fight save her planet they soon also have deal with the deadly and relentless darth maul the plot sounds bit complicated the phantom menace not only introduces earlier generation characters and immediate crisis but sets the foundation for the events that will eventually lead the fall the republic the demise the jedi knights anakin turn evil and the rise the dark empire original trilogy but the complexity not overwhelming the story moves quickly with the only drawback being that many questions predictably remain unanswered the end the film setting the stage for the next episode one the reasons the film story seems hazy not that too confusing but too unfocused unclear whose story phantom menace the original trilogy the movies were clearly luke story with the stories centering around his growth from farmboy rebel hero jedi knight but unclear whether this new film anakin story obi wan this trilogy centered anakin shaky foundation lloyd like many child actors lacks the subtle acting skills adult performers and result his character seems shallow and unimpressive screen see nothing that suggests dark side lurking underneath his little boy face for that matter any presence that would make him seem special that qui gon willing believe the one the rest the cast does fine though they often work with some iffy dialogue lucas neeson perfect aging jedi knight mcgregor well cast obi wan and conveys balance youthful energy and calm sensibility portman fits the role young queen well but her lines were often very formal giving her little room give her character much personality the biggest problem with the phantom menace not the plot the characters but the interaction between them individually the characters this new film are less developed than those the original star wars and the storyline not more confusing than previous films the series but unlike the previous trilogy lucas doesn good job playing the characters off one another star wars there were immediate contrasts and memorable exchanges between luke and han han and obi wan and leia and luke the ensemble played off each other and immediately showed their distinct attitudes and personalities the sequence where luke han and chewbacca attempt rescue leia from her cell the death star the audience learns lot about all four characters the ways they react the immediate problems and each other there comparable sequence the phantom menace flesh out the characters and their relationships with each other individually they are interesting characters with clear motivations and interests but lucas develops little chemistry tension between the them this perhaps the most glaring weakness this film and probably the reason has disappointed many reviewers but despite the need for richer dialogue and stronger character interaction the film still very engaging many the wonderful elements lucas previous films make the phantom menace both memorable and entertaining first course the remarkably rich and imaginative universe lucas creates the characters visit magical underwater cities evade dinosaur sized sea monsters fight battle droids and menacing destroyers venetian looking planet naboo watch spectacular event part roman chariot race part nascar circuit the arid desert planet tatooine then head corsucant the gothic urban capital the republic and home the galactic senate and the jedi council each location elaborate and complex lucas never settles for vague ideas about the look his settings creates rich spectacular landscapes palaces and skylines most the new special effects his released special edition trilogy 1997 were changes that allowed him give the earlier movies the look and feel that just weren possible when the films were made more than ever this new film lucas universe filled with menagerie creatures robots with personalities and supporting cast aliens who interact with the main characters the best such character watto greedy tatooine junk dealer who owns anakin and his mother slaves watto has scratchy italian voice and short paunchy body with oddly mismatched wings that flutter like hummingbird floats around the room all the computer generated

roger rabbit like presence you accept that there but you never lose sight the fact that animated character initially found jar jar annoying but grew enjoy the humor added the film second viewing the film jar jar was lot fun and didn mind him all second reason this film continues the fine tradition star wars movies that the film replete with humor and small details that flesh out the world lucas creates despite all the film struggles between good and evil and the sober musings about one destiny and the force like all star wars films the phantom menace never takes itself too seriously fortunately lucas hasn lost sight the fact that his films are entertainment not high art from the bumbling jar jar one man two headed announcer team calling the action the film thrilling pod race sequence cameo appearance the film the phantom menace simply lot fun with lots half hidden jokes and humor that can easily missed and finally the phantom menace works because all his films there shortage speed and action from beginning end there are light saber battles hair raising chases and thrilling duels between good and evil the pod race sequence tatooine one the most entertaining and exciting scenes any star wars film and the final showdown between obi wan qui gon and darth maul arguably the best choreographed most thrilling fight sequence lucas has filmed the phantom menace won win any major oscars probably won beat titanic box office record and not even the best star wars film put third after the original and the empire strikes back but exciting and entertaining film far better than your typical summer blockbuster the film can live hype film not even the original star wars could have done that but still worth seeing probably more than once

1 |text watching italian writer director dario argento much lauded murder mystery tenebrae was struck more than anything else how many sins commits storyteller and manages get away with emphasising style over matters plot argento somewhat notorious cult film circles but some aficionados still praise tenebrae the greatest his giallo murder mysteries while certainly not perfect repeated viewings reveal nonetheless densely plotted and terrifically stylish thriller the story follows promotional visit rome famous american mystery novelist peter neal anthony franciosa where discovers that serial killer the loose inspired his latest book tenebrae with the police his back for leads decides take personal interest the case and soon becomes drawn into mystery where all not seems the film benefits enormously from fine central performance franciosa brings grace charm and deceptive benigness his character which provides interesting foil both the violence the books writes and the unfolding real life horror around him the film awash with fascinating psychosexual tension argento peels back the facade showbiz and jetset lifestyles reveal amoral ambivalent shadowy world where desire all its forms has become dangerous business tenebrae perhaps the most multi layered argento scripts date and there much bubbling underneath the surface here may take least two three viewings appreciate all the psychological themes play that respect strongly recalls his previous giallo deep red profondo rosso the full length italian language version and fans will enjoy spotting the recurring themes needless say for argento fans there denying the director brilliance stylist many the action and murder sequences are directed with his characteristic finesse and feature plenty intriguing camerawork they are all the more impressive for the fact that this film argento creates mood filling his scenes with light rather than the dark shadows and deep rich colours earlier works like deep red and suspiria instead tenebrae set design and lighting paints sleek clinical chilly vision vaguely futuristic urban world and the soundtrack mix electronic atmospheres and gothic rock frequent argento collaborators goblin the perfect accompaniment tenebrae has much recommend question still constantly nagging the back this viewers mind several lumps the narrative some critics argue that logic doesn matter argento films but damnit matters all films the point where viewers don deserve feel cheated the way you don want know the solution the mystery then skip the next three paragraphs about hour into tenebrae the story takes unexpected twist which properly handled could have proved ingenious witness the murder the serial killer himself man who later discover none other than the author peter neal insane apparently the murders then continue for the remainder the film neal decides time settle some personal business involving his neurotic wife finally revealed this second killer the film bloody climax but argento muffs the twist both technically and narratively you see are supposed tricked into thinking that during this scene peter neal actually innocent witness who was crouching the bushes nearby the whole time and spying the killer house but thanks poor editing its had believe neal could have murdered the killer anyway bad cutting puts the timing way out other words almost two places once during this crucial scene are also thrown ridiculous red herring the film end you realise that for the sake alibi neal must have self inflicted nasty injury this earlier scene make look like was attacked fleeing assailant the injury banged himself the head with bloody great rock thus the revelation the hero killer and anti hero the final scenes may still prove shocking but its all somewhat implausible the time the end credits have rolled helpfully the end learn that the bizarre flashbacks personal humiliation and murder that have permeated the film belonged neal all along but there too problem the explanations offered for his motivations are psychologically fuzzy say the least the story owes better understanding franciosa mind his concealed madness and his sudden murderous rampage tenebrae also marred annoying little inconsistencies for instance teenage boy and girl leave hotel room and minutes later see the girl riding off the back motorbike would assume the rider the same boy but turns out some male character aren even introduced too that careless filmmaking pure and simple why you may ask about the story flaws because when comes visuals and set pieces argento one the most exciting filmmakers the world take one the extended scenes tenebrae upset girl wandering the streets night needlessly taunts guard dog the point where almost unbelievably jumps high fence and chases her across town finally she desperately seeks escape from this crazed canine she accidentally stumbles the serial killer lair absolutely masterful sequence tense and exciting and communicating wealth information through visuals alone and that exactly the kind thing that makes the flaws frustrating too often seems argento films whole are less than the sum their impressive parts mind you you love murder mysteries then tenebrae still worth look and you fan argento unique style giallo thriller then essential see the uncut widescreen version you can and drink some the wonderful cinematography luciano tovoli stylish great looking and quirky film despite the problem narrative shame because doesn have that way take argento more recent stendhal syndrome 1992 where with the aid writer franco ferrini fashioned solid storyline without sacrificing any his surreal weirdness visual panache proof that can tries

1 |text suppose argument could made that toy story one those films that didn need sequel beloved kids and their parents respected equally mainstream america and geekish movie buffs that first movie remains landmark recent history the one that burst open the possibilities computer animation and demonstrated through wild invention and giddy chutzpah just how complacent the disney animation machine had become cranking out fluffy razzle dazzle entertainment full formula storytelling and banal songwriting disney was embarrassed being beaten its own game toy story was smash hit unexpected proportions and one that caught the merchandising end the business unaware demand for action figures far outstripped supply didn show and distributor and part owner the property least had piece the action toy story was greenlighted direct video project disney standard tactic for milking few more bucks out hot franchises without expending the effort developing proper feature film someone who doesn believe sequels are necessarily bad thing granted they usually are bad thing but that because they made for the wrong reasons had wonder what the world they were thinking fortunately disney claimed have been knocked out early animation tests that they let pixar full speed ahead with theatrical sequel lucky thing too like the first movie this one joy behold the big screen and technically improves its predecessor just about every level from business standpoint the end credits show that the new creations are copyrighted pixar while the previous film elements are shared between pixar and disney sign the production house new cachet hollywood visually the main shortcoming this fully computer generated movie that human figures are still rendered relatively poorly making them look little creepy fortunately that eerie unreality fits perfectly with the perspective the movie where the secret world toys more immediate and arguably more attractive than the world the humans who surround them before the story predicated the premise that the toys scattered around the bedroom little boy named andy and indeed all the toys scattered around the bedrooms all little children come life the child absence while the toys scamper about and chatter endlessly among themselves the real joy toy life mean something its owner one the subjects this new film the sadness toys that have been broken abandoned left shelf gather dust and another the sort emotional limbo inhabited toys that are mere prizes covetous collectors most often those toys are packed away dark spaces safe from sunlight and humidity and often they not even removed from their packaging imagine what chip that would put your shoulder and you understand the attitudes the collector items that show this movie sheriff woody voiced note perfect tom hanks the longtime favorite among andy toys who was challenged the previous round the arrival flashy new thing action figure buzz lightyear tim allen suffers injury early the film when andy tugs too hard his arm and pulls seam apart revealing the stuffing inside this accident catalyzes some uneasieness among the toys who know too well that broken toy often forgotten toy and forgotten toy one that loses its reason for existence those anxieties are crystallized when andy mom tears through his living room collecting old toys for yard sale and there ironic twist the tale woody winds being stolen avid toy collector who needs exactly that quaint cowboy figure complete set that hopes sell japanese toy museum for sizable sum the rest andy toys who owe him quite debt resolve rescue him that this film manages turn box marked cents into symbol doom make its screed against the retention collectible toys wrongheaded profiteers fuel for metaphysical dilemma testament its skill metaphor seamlessly translating the hopes and fears our real world into that the toys operating this level abstraction toy story tackles some mighty heavy issues without once preaching veering into pretentiousness the worst can say that randy newman seems have reserved his sappiest lyric years for sarah mclachlan who stops the movie cold singing just about the halfway mark sometimes think toy story tries too hard there somewhat less the seat the pants loopiness that energized the first film allowing surprise and excite near constant basis and more philosophizing about toys collectors the nature happiness and the meaning life while that leads fewer bellylaughs does make way for more elaborate humor and uncommonly ambitious reflexivity that asks the toys consider their own status commodities that move and out fashion just don ask why andy favorite toy based series that was canceled 1957 where else mainstream movies you get such awesome moment the one where buzz arrives toy barn find stocked the gills with his doppelgangers buzz lightyear action figures forget the self congratulatory science fiction the matrix this fundamental mind bender for buzz and the audience shares his humility and wonderment the sight here the roughly concurrent scene where woody watches tapes the howdy doodyish children show that originated his character see our protagonists come face face with god sly ways then toy story can read film about mortality metaphorical consideration aging and death significantly the film very first sequence concludes with grim shocker that had our opening night crowd near uproar and toward the end when buzz and woody speculate how long they have before andy grows and discards his old toys one them observes with alacrity both inspirational and heartbreaking that will fun while lasts toy story joins the tradition children stories largely neglected late that say something real about the inevitable joys and tragedies existence what really striking that both toy story films and lesser degree pixar bug life are kids movies with wit and sophistication shame most their ostensibly adult counterparts not mention whatever piece tot friendly

usually lacking was good story and good characters and good acting etc contact being the exception and for some reason hollywood has never taken look the aliens here earth the closest that have seen anyway was 2001 space odyssey which made mankind alien race themselves being dwarfed the technology which they created now comes gattaca another film about technology reigning supreme except here our planet the difference between 2001 and this one simple gattaca more frightening most the concepts this movie are based recent discoveries genetic engineering using this premise writer director andrew niccol creates some genuine suspense and thrills unfortunately due lack advertising fear gattaca may fair horribly the box office since seeing the film have been asking people they have seen gattaca lately however have been asking them they have even heard gattaca most people don even realize that film despite this fact surely hope that the audience members who have seen this film will tell their friends about niccol film deserves more than what independence day made because smarter better produced and more realistic gattaca begins the 21st century procreating now done petri dish and genetic engineering the normal way doing natural child birth considered old fashioned are introduced jerome morrow ethan hawke employee the gattaca space program one the directors the program has been murdered and the main suspect one vincent freeman the only problem that jerome morrow vincent freeman vincent was born the natural way when his parents decided bringing their first child into the world through love however after his birth and through several genetic tests doctors tell his parents that will have chance weak heart well poor eye sight and short life span result both parents decide bring their next baby into the world via genetics anton loren dean produced without flaws and the competition between brothers spawns vincent has dream fly solo flight around the titan the 14th moon saturn but because his condition gattaca and society general forces him menial labor around the company labeled valid vincent dream seems impossible until meets black market dna specialist german tony shalhoub german introduces him valid who has been paralized from the waste down due automobile accident jerome morrow jude law agrees give vincent all the proper identification tools urine blood skin and hair samples etc that will need get past gattaca tight security exchange vincent will provide jerome with the rent money and friendship after the murder however his dreams are put risk due one vincent eyelashes left the scene the crime irene cassini uma thurman genetically flawed valid working for gattaca and she begins fall love with vincent jerome gattaca one the best science fiction films have seen long time only two other intelligent science fiction films have come out the past two years contact and the arrival and gattaca will rank among them unfortunately whenever one intelligent film comes out against special effects laden films normally gets buried the second best thing about gattaca the production design jan roelfs the orange glow gattaca scenes are impressive but the sets deserve most the credit the sets are very well done creating futuristic sense but not too futuristic alienate viewers look the designs realize that these buildings aren too far into the future this brings the plot even more credibility genetic engineering becomes more possible every passing day the best thing however the plot the story more than your average sci thriller its heart develops theme which never overpowering but always present perhaps niccol warning our race about the changes genetic tampering could bring would our society become bunch soulless zombies maybe human nature result mankind flaws get rid flaws get rid dreams well niccol intelligent script handles all these questions extremely well and the result incredibly smart thriller set against dramatic story vice versa the power the actors brings lot credibility flat characters while flat may sound like poor job niccol part actually enhances the meaning behind the story ethan hawke has developed into handsome adult actor giving his best performance his lifetime far his curiosity and motivation pushes his character past all the discouraging remarks from his parents and valid peers uma thurman well uma thurman her character slightly underdeveloped but the story isn about her however thurman gives lot depth the flat character jude law gives the most complex performance the film with the most disturbingly realistic character provides several nice touches and his final scene very touching and heartwrenching one loren dean gives nice performance his well developed character dean also responsible for some the most suspenseful scenes the movie alan arkin portrays one the detectives with little less more excitement than with his psychiatrist grosse pointe blank still does good job gore vidal and xander berkeley both provide some very good supporting roles and berkeley also gives heartfelt discussion towards the end the film gattaca rated for brief violent images language some sexuality and nudity despite the somber and desolate mood the entire film wasn exactly prepared for the ending which left feeling empty turned off slightly but then realized that everything turned out the way should have this had been typical hollywood film would have ended much differently however with all the mindless science fiction films out there nice have film which doesn talk down its audience especially like the ironic title and how consists the four letters which make the genetic coding and instead provides some much needed entertainment which gives science fiction fanatics just what want science fiction film with morals behind whatever happened giving the audience lesson while entertaining hopefully more writers and directors will learn from gattaca and hopefully audiences will too personal note gladnick how dare you call this film the worst film the year can even begin image what film you like that frightens beyond anything

1 |text you heard all the hype you seen all their faces natalie portman the professional queen amidala liam neeson schindler list qui gon jinn ewan mcgregor trainspotting obi wan kenobi and jake lloyd jingle all the way young anakin skywalker you read any reviews you also probably heard that this movie fails live the magic and humanity the first trilogy you also may have heard that this one too kiddie friendly and doesn have enough content for adults believe the hype the effects are stunning the digitalized creatures are amazingly realistic the lightsaber duels are amazing and queen amidala sumptuous robes are fit worn queen elizabeth but there something missing here and isn budget effects everything money can buy the actors struggle best they can flesh out broad stroked and flat characters the most successful this liam neeson who qui gon jinn jedi master young obi wan kenobi has quiet dignity and wise commanding presence the anchor this movie the one character who george lucas apparently spent some time fleshing out portman queen amidala and mcgregor obi wan kenobi don fare nearly well amidala the future mother luke and leia and the queen peaceful planet being invaded the trade federation comes off stoic stilted and caricatured appears though she was vulcan geisha former life and obi wan although mcgregor makes him very endearing has little screen time that nothing but robin qui gon jinn batman however mcgregor does struggle manfully infuse this surprisingly small supporting role with spark genuine insight and humanity and does good job also absolutely nails alec guiness obi wan episode scottish accent and that really makes his presence the film more profound than might have been otherwise fact lucas seems bank that preexisting knowledge quite bit and that one the problems with this film would never call myself star wars fan especially not considering what means fanatic these days but always enjoyed the films along with everyone else america however you are the one person america who hasn seen the films all even recently who doesn bother brush the names obscure characters you may hopelessly lost for example one the film main nefarious characters senator palpatine for those you not recently steeped star wars trivia emperor palpatine that scary hooded apparition who was darth vader master return the jedi and empire strikes back obviously his appearance phantom menace meant stir some echoes his later role the series thus making his role here more meaningful lot the movie like that and 3po make token appearances and obvious that lucas banking the audience pre existing fondness for them because doesn much add any way same goes for jabba the hutt who doesn look much mean here does corpulent and lazy even planets make foreshadowing guest appearances this film tatooine the desert world where luke grew coruscant the cloud city from empire strikes back and alderaan leia home planet which never actually see that gets blown star wars show are mentioned briefly passing what the result tying many plot points and characters future films the answer that this one seems surprisingly empty there meat substance that makes you want love the characters they are not they will another problem that there are actually too many alien characters the film was distracted the fact that two the main evil characters strange looking aliens who looked like gila monsters had mouths that barely moved making them look more like muppets than actual characters and jar jar binks silly roger rabbitish amphibious character intended comic relief but what really becomes annoying and fast unlike chewbacca and 3po who got their humanity you pardon the expression from their interactions with the human characters jar jar often left interact mostly with others his kind times making the movie seem like nothing more than very expensive teenage mutant ninja turtles furthermore the dialogue often stilted and corny and sometimes downright infantile thereby rendering some characters into nothing more than bystanders the plot oddly this isn just judgment lucas has said that designed this film for kids well done good job the hero this film course young anakin but was very hard for feel any kinship identify with eight year old boy that not jake lloyd fault though does good job being cute kid which apparently all lucas asked him that another mistake course because the cute tyke becomes darth vader warning spoilers ahead opinion there was not nearly enough foreshadowing anakin future evil the film the boy all blond flowing hair and rosy cheeks and there nothing more than spark aggression him throughout the entire movie has doting mother pernilla august making her first english language film and slave gross flying gnome tatooine but the only indication the audience gets that this kid isn all hearts and roses yoda hesitation allowing him train jedi under qui gon jinn his explanation his future clouded warning major spoiler ahead enter your own risk course the noble qui gon dies the hand darth maul scary looking sith lord who excels the jedi arts but has turned the dark side this dude has maybe two lines the entire movie but establishes his presence through his amazing moves with his double sided lightsaber and his scary facial makeup because qui gon never gets chance train the young anakin the ways the force obi wan qui gon young padawan apprentice one level below knightdom must take over the training himself the end the movie end where the saga actually begins with obi wan kenobi and his young apprentice anakin darth vader skywalker did this story need told would say but worthwhile movie see absolutely you don enter the theater with jedi size expectations and you simply want treated enjoyable visual spectacle then this your movie the tatooine pod races are triumph effects and computer animation the digitalized backgrounds some the planets are astonishing sight and yoda and young obi wan are worth seeing for their origins simpler happier time above all this fun movie not deep not meaningful and not profound but fun maybe next time lucas will hire lawrence kasdan write the script and the guy who directed empire will direct because lucas does the next one himself will lacking the one thing needs the most potential

his oldest daughter played marcia gay harden from millers crossing who has been obsessively planning his sinfully extravagant birthday party presents him with three superbly decorated little cakes which are supposed scale models for his big birthday cake the daughter asks hopkins pick the one likes hopkins frustrated the weight planning for the whole elaborate affair does what any man his position would punts whichever one you like dear says and the daughter does exactly what any woman her position would she cries liked that scene for two reasons first the cakes looked really cool second was perhaps the only scene the movie where people acted you would expect people act meet joe black chock full odd performances people doing things for discernible reason all and doing them slow motion over the course three hours boot easy watch meet joe black for the abundant eye candy the palatial homes and the beauteous claire forlani but even easier sleep right through two people row managed quite nicely the difficult part the movie understanding the characters and their motivations and why someone thought three hours was appropriate length for this overwrought mess know audience had problems with the movie because they thought was comedy case point everyone should know now that brad pitt plays the angel death this movie however the first see him young lawyer coffee shop hitting the glamorous claire forlani not clear from the movie whether you need law degree become the angel death but makes certain kind sense shouldn take long for the observant moviegoer realize that bad things are about happen pitt and indeed they after hideously prolonged sequence where pitt looks over his shoulder the retreating forlani and forlani looks over her shoulder the retreating pitt because pitt walks into the road without looking and suddenly gets squished well when that happened the audience howled with laughter and continued laugh every comment that was remotely humorous you think that sudden violent death and sarcastic drawing room humor are funny encourage you see meet joe black immediately anyway the deceased lawyer body worse the wear from its massive injuries possessed the angel death and brad pitt takes over that role the idea that death given the pen name joe black not disturb others wants take holiday and experience the world this weren hollywood might get interesting metaphysical discussion life and death but since get scene after scene fish out water humor just death george the jungle crocodile dundee some other poor schmuck who wandered from the jungle the outback whatever and doesn know how act our society also doesn help that the character death written inconsistently claims vacation but never does anything except hang around the seriously attractive claire forlani just try get your travel agent book that one speaks very slow and halting english but perfectly fluent jamaican patois knows everything about some characters nothing about others and played brad pitt not especially menacing charming glamorous intriguing just there someone told pitt never mind about acting this picture son just stand there and look pretty pitt doing his keanu reeves impression throughout the movie used the phrase angel death this review very deliberately contrast pitt performance with this year best angel performance nicolas cage city angels where pitt cold and unfeeling cage warm and empathetic the situation allows where cage genuinely curious about the nature man pitt aloof and arrogant cage struck instant chemical sparks with star meg ryan where the chemistry between pitt and forlani only understandable you accept the notion that forlani character shallow that she can see beyond pitt good looks the movie other top name much better actor but that doesn save meet joe black sir anthony hopkins isn given much better material work with unfortunately plays one these good hearted multimillionaire media moguls that only exist hollywood one wonders what might have happened they had made hopkins character more realistically evil hopkins marked for death due bad ticker but death steps and grants him some extra time exchange for being his guide the world course one can sure how they will act when death taps their shoulder but have wonder and this movie you have very long time wonder how you would act similar situation especially you were multimillionaire hopkins pretty much goes the office and the major subplot revolves around who will control the corporation fans corporate intrigue will fascinated sure stayed awake all the way through meet joe black and asking myself why movies about death should encourage you live life the fullest which what going now spend time with your family volunteer for local charity heck take nap

make hollywood there reason why the average sane movie goer will interested such topic one going enrich their life have good time watching material such this the lack quality filmmaking 8mm from technical acting stands out even more when you consider the star writer and supporting cast all reputable but joel schumacher and his brand unlikable filmmaking strikes again like paul schrader schumacher has his moments but they few and far far between basically this picture crap and one should pay see why not walk out well this wouldn thorough review about thoroughly bad movie here why you should spend your money dog food gum instead 8mm first thing you don heed advice then understand what you about see before you even think about paying good money for this crud not easy watch didn know the details the story beforehand but least ignorance can help others now the plot revolves around tom welles nicolas cage surveillance expert and private investigator rich old woman discovers snuff film her late husband safe she calls welles and hires him try and find out the young girl had young girl didn schumacher who appears murdered the film really dead she horrified that her husband would have owned such film 8mm course and just wants welles snoop around without police interference see what can find family man welles agrees against better judgement any concrete leads even after cringing and grimacing the sight the grotesque murder let backtrack for moment see snuff films are pornos with violent twist people are tortured very sick ways and end dead however the deaths are often staged and those cases special effects and good acting make all the difference very sick people enjoy and pay top dollar for these hard find movies the thought this industry makes want throw computer out the window and stop this review but swallow bile and move welles follows clues hollywood and the porn industry you think sherlock holmes the way clues drop easily for him comes across smut clerk max joaquin phoenix who knows everyone and everything the underground business sleaze after lot digging and bribing welles finds the men who are responsible for making this and other snuff films skip ahead skip ahead skip ahead led dino velvet peter stormare uncharacteristically terrible performance and star torturer machine christopher bauer they have big showdown with welles where death and mayhem ensue the movie doesn end there unfortunately because welles has what all heroes schumacher films become vigilante this film doesn draw you keeps you about 700 miles away from and who their right mind would want get close possible like film that focuses grime and sick behaviour se7en but takes large measure restraint schumacher has none and larger amount talent schumacher has little those jabs not only referring his stylish destruction the batman franchise but time kill was immensely overrated disappointment for guy who gets much studio money his track record making rather bad movies unparalleled good screenwriter and good director can make you hypnotically watch even disgusting subject matter writer andrew kevin walker didn recapture the smarts the fascinating script authored for 95s twisted thriller se7en director schumacher doesn have that innate ability make you watch things you don really want see like better directors are capable doing must not have believed hitchcock who espoused the theory that what don see more frightening than what especially when scene where young girl supposed murdered however gratuitous joel middle name must think that not flaunting hard core act violent sex showing plenty tactful restraint doesn that far but see enough unpleasantness doesn leave much the imagination manipulating hurt kill young girls just get the audience the side murderous vigilante the script and acting should what gets believe these characters yet schumacher has subtlety his craft case point shot christian fellowship bus good right drives away reveal one the villains bad right see subtlety does joel think stupid that need held the hand comprehend the contrasting imagery who root for this mess there anybody out there not all the director fault though why did the actors sign for this nicolas cage oscar winner for cryin out loud claims films challenge himself and for the artistic merit rather than the money what was smoking when this script dropped his veranda what cage supposed this movie whispering batman without the charisma and pointed ears villainous peter stormare five steps past hammy and what james gandolfini doing this trash was solid concerned father civil action guess nic pete and jim were promised mountain money they suckers they just don care there are moments albeit brief ones where this rises above the wasteland catherine keener good although too quick threaten divorce mrs wells baby cindy obviously cute and wells devout love his daughter sweet the mother amy norton the girl the infamous 8mm film not too bad woman dealing with the uncertain loss her runaway daughter this film has appropriate blue toned washed out look like payback which was much better movie the editing okay scenes dialogue but other times rough during some conversations close ups and wide shots are not cut very well making look editted someone whose instincts aren good and whose timing was half second off such technical error indeed stands out speaking standing out don believe the misleading trailers there not much action here occasionally yes but not often your will have you believe after seeing 8mm may not interested ever watching any kind porn again that positive well making almost ill the thought glimpsing dirty movie again their motive they done swell job here long time before give schumacher film another chance unless lose mind and become seriously depraved but today not depraved ask why does this film preach that this garbage out there and that society should worried about sure that somewhere right now there some pretty sick crap going but that doesn mean need know about yes walker your script tells that there are some screwed folks out there yes walker the proverbial monster doesn look like expect him you said all that 1995 move this film serves purpose doesn entertain doesn teach anything doesn make statement beyond the obvious this stuff bad approach only this film awakens the authorities find way abolish these types horrors would ever someting truly worthwhile that not likely happen though 8mm indeed scummy waste money orson welles said years ago tribute film movies good movies only joel schumacher and the producers had listened and told andrew kevin walker bury this crud deep hole like snuff films 8mm should never have been made now excuse while try

recognized his field and his artist wife lillian miriam healy louie who reluctantly stands behind her husband suppressing her natural artistic tendencies order make the marriage work and still other secrets that have greater implication for the world and are deadly political sense science carried out the big corporations like was business run for the bottom line receiving summer grant study chemo electric therapy geoffrey and his wife are hoping that summer spent away from the intensity the big city will bring back the romance that dwindling from their marriage and that the casualness the country atmosphere will give them more time together their three year marriage has become shaky because more interested his work than her has slyly managed keep his work secretive possible locking himself the lab which off limits her secretly goes about conducting experiments rats and mice convincing her that what doing benefit humanity with possible new treatments and cures illnesses his main argument that this what the public wants they don want hear about how some animals had die because these experiments they just want the benefits science that depicted monster creating another monster much like frankenstein was created the argument skewed the director against his bad science science business opposed the good science science that cares about the small farmer which represented the handsome and almost perfect gentleman alex vine david young ecologist who chooses work the field trying get the farmers back organic farming hired the university monitor the dangers pesticides and all the chemicals the farmer almost forced use survive financially doing irreparable harm him and the consumer because all the health risks attached this new way farming methods that have just come about the last thirty years and are being pushed the big companies enhance their profit margins the third view all this the artist represented lillian who points out that the artist work shown public and scrutinized constantly why shouldn the same true the scientist she argues that the artist the watchdog for the public questioning what good evil society something that bad science has completely ignored geoffrey impatient get ahead with his research feels bogged down the bureaucrats his firm who fail provide him with the three chimps needs experiment contacts one the company higher ups argue his case but decides can wait any longer for their help sets animal trap the countryside and catches chester the gorgeous pet dog frances dog that means much her and her family because saved her life while out the field with the bloodied trapped dog already the back seat his car spotted alex and one his workers and nervously invites them dinner with his wife afraid that alex will spot what doing rushes away from the area the dinner scene that was unfortunately flatly done but was nevertheless the heart the film all the main characters get chance speak out from the point view they represent they eat meat means getting protein that the radical scientists have eschewed since they became politically correct about everything the scientists engage rational argument highlighting their different points view while lillian reacts emotional way siding mostly with david view but coming from much different angle was the actors were puppets strings that the director controlled and they just spewed out their generalized philosophies that the director point view absolutely right beside the point the point that the characters lost their humanity and became one dimensional characters geoffrey was likened hideous monster alex vine was likened his last name the one who holds fast the ground ensuring that the plant has stability while lillian was likened the muse poetry and art the inspiration for goodness and beauty alex has been spending lot time together with lillian these two seem share the same views and are physically attracted each other but when the time ripe for affair take place between them lillian changes her mind and decides not alex apartment geoffrey already suspicious alex and considers him enemy and the marriage seems coming apart and all his cunning tricks possess her are longer working now impossible see any good him and there becomes reason why she would remain with him the relationship has disintegrated way beyond the point her just feeling lonely

david loving gesture for her stay with him instead opting head back the city the farmer whose dog was tortured death comes into the scientist lab and knocks him cold while was the middle phone conversation with one the higher ups who told him all the animals needs are the way what progress what can one expect out life the small farmer about become extinct the answers these questions can best answered either good science art which are both closely related the american natives vision world entrusted mankind that can respect and take care and enrich with his creations benefit mankind peaceful way that this work fails subtle and polarizes opinions leaving room for deeper arguments the shame this decent and smart film that tried hard say what felt had say but said loudly without trusting its audience catch its message not making everything seem black and white telling said lot about the harmful trends sees science going probably said too much and would have been better off its vision was more poetical and less didactic there something about listening lecture that turns off the rebel don like being hit the head with the truth but prefer have presented the form that leads inspiration told metaphorically that not say that found the film without considerable merit that inspite its shortcomings was worth seeing because its visual statements though they were also not too subtle they were least effective setting the intense mood that the film needed show that there mental war going currently those who believe one way right and others who differ with them and that anyone who neutral must considered enemy because their indifference the stakes this ecological struggle are that high perhaps the most powerful visual statement the film was the dead cow from pesticides shown the opening scene was the image that lillian spent her time painting all summer and had the same affect for her did the animal faces picasso guernica had for him both artists envisioned the horrors that man could against the world and represented this unspoken pain the faces the animals that anyone who cares really see what going will not mistake which side the fence she should the pain that lillian feels she forgets about her desires raise family and she stares her painting the cow and the song make the world away blares out from the background after she has learned

1 |text has been three long years since quentin tarantino stunned the cinema world claiming the cannes film festival palme 100 million plus box office gross and oscar nomination all for his sophomore outing pulp fiction since then the talented film maker has been virtually invisible surfacing briefly director the wildly uneven four rooms and the screenwriter the gory vampire fest from dusk till dawn between has moonlighted actor with several decidedly unmemorable performances now with much fanfare and anticipation tarantino has returned with his third directorial effort jackie brown and while this motion picture adapted from elmore leonard novel rum punch offers solid entertainment those expecting another bravura outing from tarantino will leave theaters disappointed for the most part jackie brown pretty ordinary crime movie the story which starts out slowly develops into twisty affair with double crosses and triple crosses and the movie littered with occasional tarantino trademarks witty dialogue unexpected gunfire 70s pop tunes and close ups womens bare feet yet for all that the production something letdown the sheer your face exuberance that marked reservoir dogs and especially pulp fiction absent the mostly straightforward chronology jackie brown doesn match favorably the non linear style tarantino previous efforts approach that added tension and edginess the narratives and there aren nearly many deliciously offbeat conversations this time around there samuel jackson monologue about guns jackson chris tucker argument regarding the merits hiding car trunk and jackson robert niro exchange that recalls some the jackson travolta material from pulp fiction but that about jackie brown lone innovation its presentation crucial sequence from three different perspectives this isn exactly original technique has been done numerous times before most famously akira kurosawa rashomon and most recently edward zwick courage under fire however while those two movies and others there was legitimate plot reason for the multiple points view tarantino sole purpose for using appears because unconventional had the scenes question been shown from only one the three vantages nothing would have been lost result this aspect the film little more than curiosity for the second picture row tarantino attempting revive the career 70s icon this time around instead john travolta blaxploitation queen pam grier foxy brown has become jackie brown one many nods the most famous segment grier career tarantino uses 70s song accompany her first appearance during the opening credits there are also several instances during jackie brown when the director offers sly wink towards certain conventions the blaxploitation genre although grier never does any butt kicking grier jackie brown flight attendant who gets caught transporting drugs and money into the united states she working for gun dealer ordell robbie samuel jackson but she keeps her mouth shut under questioning despite pressure from ray nicolet michael keaton federal official longer sure whether not can trust jackie ordell arranges for bail bondsman max cherry robert forster banyon post the necessary 000 then plans shoot jackie she proves disloyal jackie passes ordell test however and soon the two them are plotting way smuggle 500 000 ordell money into the united states without tipping off the feds soon just about everyone after that money including jackie max ray ordell perpetually oversexed and drugged out girlfriend melanie bridget fonda and his right hand man louis robert niro unsurprisingly the most memorable performance turned samuel jackson but ordell isn nearly invigorating compelling character jules from pulp fiction addition looking fantastic pam grier also quite good although hers not oscar caliber performance although she might get nomination robert forster and michael keaton are solid their tough guys who rarely smile roles bridget fonda around for three discernible reasons look sexy bikini provide little twisted comedy and satisfy tarantino foot fetish robert niro criminally underused part that could have been played equally well any grungy looking middle aged actor the film which clocks several minutes over the two and half hour mark probably too long for the material but the plot convoluted enough keep guessing throughout although the payoff letdown tarantino keeps things moving along nicely with heavier dose humor and less violence than pulp fiction but the whole this movie seems more like the work one his wannabes than something from the director himself when comes recent caper films like the grifters and bound jackie brown second tier effort entertaining diversion but not masterpiece and certainly not oscar contender
1 |text all know the fate child play which the same for almost any film these days that does marginally well financially sequel hell with the newest installment the quasi popular series currently out that would bride chucky and grossed million its opening weekend which think the sign the apocalypse number five kinda fun back and see how all began rougly ten years ago with the original task which retread for some and for others namely myself chance see what all the fuss was about alas the original child play actually isn that bad even seeing the tiny claustrophobic and mechanically challenged theatre college wasn the horribly dull experience thought would not just because the nicely rowdy crowd which you almost need watch film like this and you don believe try and watch this flick yourself one day but because whole this isn bad movie not great but does have two things that many horror films like this one don have rather nifty premise and sense humor both which save this from horror hell which precisely where say know what you did last summer has recently gone the premise child play that serial killer named charles lee ray brad douriff shot and almost killed chicago hard boiled detective chris surrandon see what happens some oscar nominees and before dies utters voodoo chant that sends his soul directly into kid doll called chucky doll which has got the scariest looking kid doll ever seen the next day bum who stolen sells single mother karen barclay catherine hicks who then gives her young son andy alex vincent for his birthday course chucky begins talking the kid and trying find way get out the doll but certain twists come like the guy learned voodoo from reveals him that the only way break the curse take over the body the first person told was inside the doll that being andy and soon enough chucky killing people either for revenge for what seems like fun and people are discovering that chucky isn just kiddie doll one one the idea neat one ripe for lots comic terror and luckily utlizes lot that plays with idea stolen from classic looney toons short that when someone knows that chucky alive they tell people about but when tries prove themselves chucky does nothing and everyone thinks they crazy plays with this well the whole child like thought that dolls and toys come life and even manages cram couple really frightening moments even there entire sequence devoted cliches woman alone house hears noise goes investigate and finds nothing but wait for the kicker second later there also harrowing car ride with chucky trying knife the detective from the back seat and then trying attack him when the car finally crashes leaving the viewer with least rather visceral exprience the ending rather fun well albeit tad too drawn out about four different endings maybe five and the characters are more intelligent than the average horror film line making them easier sympathize with there one horrible thing about many horror films that the protagonists are morons who you can help but shout obscenities and for the most part child play steers away from that and most all the chucky character good one not just because provides instant comic relief look that doll moving its own but because generally scary character there anything really wrong with child play that too trite and has too less self esteem almost minutes child play features way too less real classic horror throws itself into simple three act set that renders quick and almost forgettable weren for the fact that the film deals with psychotic doll the film had more confidence what was presenting would really push the envelope and become even more than just short bit horror escapism which precisely why this kind film only memorable cheap little horor film which isn necessarily bad thing such child play content just the short typical horror film but saves itself via sense humor and nice quasi campy feel that makes much more enjoyable than the average short typical horror film

stole apple that taran was trying use bring back hen wen when hears hen wen squeal from far away though races her rescue only see her get kidnapped dragonlike gwythants taran chases after the gwythants and finds himself staring the horned king castle from far away taran climbs the castle walls and brings himself into the castle where attempts rescue hen wen manages but himself captured and thrown into the dungeon there meets princess eilonwy and her magic bauble another thing which the horned king was hoping use find the cauldron and the two escape through the deep castle walls along the way taran finds sword burial chamber and they rescue comic bard named fflewdurr flamm who has harp whose strings break whenever tells lie the three manage escape the horned king castle but not

lifeless body reappears before the heartbroken group taran cradles him his arms though gurgi stirs not dead after all the happy group then returns home where hen wen brought home the fairfolk once the dangers are past dallben and even doli await their triumphant return spectacular sounds the black cauldron really suffered lot its past times before ron miller was fired from his position chairman walt disney productions had bought novel lloyd alexander called the black cauldron sword and sorcery tale for the studio bringing this book the screen was the studio fondest dream miller who entitled himself the executive producer promised that they would after they had proved themselves other projects when micheal eisner and his executives arrived the disney animation studio the animators were struggling complete the black cauldron this time things had gone really rocky for the animation department many the studio old men had retired died therefore the animators suffered hard time making this film originally budgeted million the costs raised million because constant changes everything and when was finally released june 1985 the black cauldron was greeted praising reviews from some critics but somehow the film flopped the film was rated and the film although disneyfied from lloyd alexander chronicles prydain which what this film based was much more scarier and darker than disney other previous efforts such the rescuers and the fox and the hound which probably why many people considered too scary and stayed away from addition other critics rejected for having heart and unmemorable compared other disney animated features but whatever the real reason the black cauldron was financial disaster grossing only million the failure the film grounded the studio animation department and exiled the animation team annex buildings nearby glendale and seemed like animated features would longer become part the studio reputation the next two disney animated features the great mouse detective and oliver and company although little more lighthearted than the black cauldron didn much better although oliver and company grossed much more than the black cauldron and the great mouse detective only with the little mermaid did the studio regain its reputation for successful animated features for the black cauldron was rereleased some cities for temporary time under the title taran and the magic cauldron finally the studio locked the film the film vault and denied that ever even was released because all this you might ask yourself was the black cauldron really such bad movie the people who had seen the film didn think fact many people had calls buena vista home video requesting for the film but course they denied for while seemed like the black cauldron would never released video until september 1997 disney released the black cauldron video the united kingdom few people imported the video from england and converted ntsc including and for those who hadn seen the film yet included here they got quite treat but people who had bootleg copies the black cauldron noticed that the scene where the horned king raises his army deathless warriors about seconds ghoulish looking skeletons were slightly trimmed that the film would get rating the the rating means universal suitable for all ages kinda like their own version somewhere online team diehard the black cauldron fans signed petition that said bring back the black cauldron and because that disney finally decided release the video the united states before that time rumors online had been made that the video would trimmed like the video that would get rating and that they would add songs those rumors were put rest when the walt disney company announced that the black cauldron would released its rated version even still when was finally released the some reaction was mixed some felt that was indeed cut but some felt that wasn but these where only minor criticisms which seemed laughable since film that was absent for thirteen years was finally available for myself when saw the movie for the first time converted ntsc video didn expect much all fact had heard many mediocre things about that didn think the film would ever such good film much surprise when saw the first few minutes the film was asking myself this the same film everyone saw the one that flopped the box office the one that critics and filmgoers alike called bad movie this doesn seem like all the above instead classic its own right the film has wonderful cast characters there taran grant bardsley assistant pig keeper who would rather warrior than pig keeper the story hero the critics have said that taran not likeable all but the opposite true brave loyal and eventually learns lesson about friendship later there likeable character here not that the only likeable character the film there gurgi john biner lovable little thing who remains loyal taran even though they don quite hit off first but another likeable character the bad guy comic henchman dwarf named creeper phil fondacairo who loyal the film imaginative and sinister villain the horned king voiced gruesomely john hurt yet also fears his neck the other characters including the sidekicks spunky but sweet princess named eilonwy and the comic bard fflewdurr flamm and three comically wicked witches who hide dark secret although pleasant and likeable aren quite well rounded they should the story itself adventurous one quest involving the mystical pig hen wen the black cauldron itself and army deathless ones with everything hooking opening spectacular finale elmer bernstein music also tells the story perfectly dark yet calming manner the animation itself surprisingly good considering that this film was created the darkest time the studios even though there are some occasional effects that are not quite good like the ground opening when the black cauldron rises out the earth the animation overall top notch overall this film entertaining endeavor fans unfamiliar the lloyd alexander chronicles prydain will get kick out this one except young kids there are some extremely scary scenes which are more darker than disney other films although some consider the stampede sequence from the lion king and frollo observing esmeralda the fires hell the hunchback notre dame are just scary which the main reason why this film rated fans familiar the lloyd alexander series will recognize the differences between the novel and the movie even though doesn have all the ingredients true disney film this film classic its own right and deserves far better chance than what has been given that better chance has finally come whatever reason about why the black cauldron was such big failure seems have disappeared and the film has

intelligence make human being out neo nazi skinhead kind person who dedicates their lives hating anyone who not what they are and this film wisely and miracurously pulls off the subject this film one them but worse than one the blind followers that make most skinhead members since the leader the pack the one who instigates them take firm grip onto their rage and then another brilliant stroke justifies with political propoganda that makes eerie sense when speaks utterly convincing public speaker and firm his convictions that comes shock when actually goes through the rehabilitation process his name derek vinyard and played edward norton with much fire and intensity that when speaks almost convincing and arresting public speaker say malcom when first see him clean shaven with jet black swastica emrboidered his left breast devlish goatee and attacking the black carjackers outside his house dressed nothing but his white boxers and carrying handgun his hand that never seems run out bullets least when doesn need them believes his convictions that willing put his beliefs the test even knows will mean stop prison only for couple years american history about derek how became neo nazi skinhead how rose power how was rehabilitated prison after murdering two black men fit rage that was less with the stealing his car and more with proving himself and how tried save others namely his younger brother from making the same mistake see him all these stages smart teenager vicious hate monger man having epiphany and the man who tries correct what done before and all these get portrait man from all sides least that the intention the film framing device his brother danny edward furlong perpetually looking about also now skinhead and how his principal bob sweeney avery brooks who just found out was the captain star trek deep space trying correct him when the film opens danny has just written book report mein kampf landing him trouble with sweeney which causes him make him write paper derek life and how has gotten him nowhere coincidentally this day the day derek released from prison and when see him cleaned not buff and has full head hair just intelligent but still very rough along the edges but wisened longer controlled his anger blacks and jews and tries persuade danny who becoming what derek was before give his lifestyle but danny won goes large skinhead beer bash meets with the skinhead leader stacy keach and then discovers that derek opposed neo nazi dom was for couple years ago the film circles around this then spins off into non linear flashbacks all done black and white mostly see derek his prime skinhead living venice beach organizing vicious and quasi sadistic raids local stores that longer hire the white middle class teenagers since they can easily get cheaper illegal immigrants the same work and mouthing off his theories affirmative action and how illegal immigrants and blacks have destroyed the fundamentals this country was built them the white man the one who has gotten the fuzzy end the lolipop and not only speaks elloquently forcefully and intelligently but backs everything with political reasons justifying their rage least them and frighteningly enough much what says sounds true american history collection really great scenes and moments rather than cohesive great film that flows effortlessly from one moment the next there are some the best scenes seen all year one scene features dinner between derek family and his mother newest boyfriend played with reserve eliott gould jewish liberal who quietly disagrees with derek rightist views launching the scene into fit rage and anger that builds unparalled emotions the audience gould reaction derek final summation unnerrving another scene uses humor and traditional macho sex talk build friendship and nice connection between derek and black worker guy torry while folding laundry prison and another soon classic actually divided two the murder the two black men that winds derek jail which contains final murder nasty that may the most revoltingly shocking all year there much more appreciate like the acting which uniformly good with stand outs coming from avery brooks beverly angelo the long suffering mother and gould who has one horrible line but other than that comes off with the best performance given what seems like really long time norton walks off with the film though coming off with such intensity that reduces anyone not doing adequate job rubble only the fifth movie his career norton has invented himself one the most reliable and intense actors his generation and maybe the best there nothing like when norton really gets rolling this movie spewing out lines with such authority that commands all attention from the audience coming off with power similar that young maron brando that allows the little emotions seep through amazing sadly enough this isn going the great portrait racism that perhaps hopes too unambitious and even little contrived really take off either powerful statement emotional masterpiece the ending especially pencilled from other movies tossed just the emotional keyboard can trounced upon some the skinheads are reduced mere cliches kevin smith regular ethan suplee fairs rather annoyingly the fat skinhead whose lines consist without fail expressing his desire eat more and even the dramatic arc isn well travelled furlong danny never seems really learning lesson since the flashbacks refuse show his point view and when decides make change the end which was inevitable doesn seem like has actually arrived there even derek descent into skinhead dom doesn seem justified though his fireman father william russ the dad from boy meets world and don ask how know that killed black junkie and even before spoke against affirmative action intelligently there never seems any real back story why derek became intense about his beliefs such one can see why the director tony kaye wanted have his name removed sorta american history very good movie and was very moved but could lot better and the problem seems that the cut not what claims his potential somewhere claims there lies tony kaye cut and that was the true cut until was viewed norton who then ordered another cut and that thus although aimed for the directing credit alan smithee the resident name for any film that disowned its director wasn allowed him under the grounds that once you disown film you can not badmouth but really that the macguffin one really wanted film this good given the alan smithee sign disapproval kaye right that not par even not referring normal par but rather his own personal par this will not the right thing for the late 90s yet still gets its point across intelligently and backs with its story its message that one cannot enwrapped one own beliefs pain and suffering will occur literally said over the narration unfortunately and even isn perfect least when avery brooks turns norton after has been beaten and raped prison and asks him anything done has made his life any better realy hits nerve not only derek but also the audience

failure for sequel live even surpass the original greatness very rare indeed and whereas babe pig the city misses equaling the greatness its best picture nominated predecessor babe worthy companion piece more than that spectacular work art that deserves stand alone its own right babe pig the city warrants the classification being recognized with such classics like the godfather part and the empire strikes back being one the greatest sequels ever produced babe pig the city picks precisely where babe left off having won the sheep herding competition farmer hoggett james cromwell and his pig are elevated fame status series unfortunate circumstances and hilariously freakish events leads mrs hoggett taking babe from the small country farm into the big city doing the film transports into wonderfully imaginative world that simultaneously mirrors and exceeds the creative design seen the original babe pig the city flourishes where many sequels fail most sequels simply rehash the events the first film not babe pig the city this completely original tale that offers story drastically different than the first also not being content utilize most the old characters this film gives many new ones enjoy essence doesn attempt copy itself instead strives achieve originality its own and succeeds that not say the familiar absent babe pig the city retains some the best core elements and characters from the first film along with babe himself ferdinand the duck comes along for the ride does mrs hoggett one this decade best and most underappreciated comic characterizations hilariously performed magda szubanski the three singing mice also make the journey chiming with their cute high pitched vocals the story structure also similar each segment introduced with title cards read the aforementioned mice from there are guided once again roscoe lee browne soothingly deep narrative composer nigel westlake also returns with his whimsical music style that perfect for cinematic fables such these but these elements are simply the frame that surrounds entirely new painting while staying the flealands hotel babe encounters veritable ark full new animals monkeys kittens and dogs various breeds and sizes are some the new urbanites that babe befriends well some wonderfully comical pelicans that ferdinand the duck happens encounter each character distinctly unique some which are

came unexpected pleasant surprise see who was not ruin this well kept secret won reveal the actor identity here was treat indeed see one cinema legends grace the screen again what was superbly gentle and heartwarming performance the greatest triumph babe pig the city the art direction simply put bleeds creativity taking the look the original film whole new level restricted primarily farm the first time around this second installment creates entire city dazzling with unique fable like architecture but the stroke pure genius production designer roger ford his use our world architectural landmarks designing skyline that includes the statue liberty the sydney opera house the brooklyn bridge the hollywood sign and the eiffel tower ford has created singular city that encompasses all our cities seen the film photo and pre production drawing your right added that many this city streets are the twin siblings venice gondola trekked rivers the metropolis that has sprung from ford vision wondrous sight behold world that you want walk around norma moriceau costume designs belong this world vibrant color and style equal that the ford landscape most the costumes are imaginatively cartoonish with the most exotically grand design going that fugly floom clown outfit andrew lesnie photography captures these elements with various lighting moods that are beautifully effective creating the film multiple emotional tones much press fodder has been made over the weeks leading the release babe pig the city reports stated that its original cut was branded with rating these reports were discovered false was assigned rating but even anything harsher than the original rating had many parents and fans arms deleting minimal number shots babe pig the city was eventually given the coveted rating although appeased many fans were still concerned that would too dark fearing that the film may have come possessed tim burton himself well coin phrase the reports babe pig the city death the hands dark scary felliniesque interpretation have been greatly exaggerated granted has its moments pseudo morbidity but all all babe pig the city the funny and charming adventure that everyone was hoping would whatever dark moments may have can attributed director george miller the mad max trilogy the witches eastwick lorenzo oil having served producer and writer the first film miller moves into the director chair for this one putting his own unique sense style into this budding franchise the story babe pig the city enchanting yarn but one that doesn achieve the emotional character depth the original missing here the attempt broach such heady themes personal identity individual worth challenging conformity and one purpose life babe dealt with this weighty subject matter creating timeless fable babe pig the city should not have rehashed these themes but wish would have attempted explore new ones this film not bereft moral message parallels such issues urban strife class differences sacrificial courage and but this film goals aren lofty the first instead choosing take more straightforward approach allowing its themes take back seat exciting sometimes intense fable adventure that undeniably clever and inventive babe pig the city also decides against developing relationship the level which was present the first film specifically the one between farmer hoggett and babe hoggett love for babe which grew ever gently what gave that film its charming and endearing quality best exemplified hoggett dance for babe this moving relationship was truly unique something that wish would have been present again and could have through fugly floom but was not please understand these are not negative criticisms per but simply statements what see the differences between babe pig the city being very good film and the original being great one but having said that these observations are minor critiques best overall piece babe pig the city thoroughly enchanting and entertaining fable from beginning end sure isn great film but excellent one that possesses elements greatness film that magical with its charm and humor exciting its adventurous exploits funny with its dry wit and cute voices and breathtaking its presentation babe pig the city may not moviemaking its absolute best but level cinematic quality that rarely achieved seen cinema result you choose let this film pass you you will missing the year best cinematic treats

-1 |text reindeer games easily the worst the three recent films penned ehren kruger scream and arlington are the others each derivative their own special way the guy can seem write believable dialogue sample from reindeer games rule never put car thief behind the wheel create multi faceted characters even engineer coherent plots but sure knows how pile numerous nonsensical twists and turns matter each one deems the actual story increasingly unlikely his screenplay for reindeer games turns the tables the audience many times that watching the film becomes something punishment with reward anywhere sight can just envision kruger laughing behind his keyboard you thought movie was gonna here you jack ass take that twist decipher this mother cker almost the writer were angry for shelling out money see his stupid movie and why the hell would anyone want invest time movie when the screenwriter keeps changing his own rules for reason other than congratulate himself how damn clever auteur theory damned kruger style not the director that winds screen kruger has obviously never paid much mind the old chestnut sometimes less more and his numerous twists can even claim originals arlington ending direct steal from the much better alan pakula thriller the parallax view and reindeer games get this gem character incriminates themself saying something they shouldn know pronouns used protect the gender the character grammar damned how did you know that the stunned protagonist asks suddenly realizing that the character was the whole thing all along since twist endings are currently vogue and seeing how kruger screenplays usually come equipped with about three twists per ending guess wonder why works frequently quickly becoming miramax mickey mouse the company has already signed him work several their upcoming projects this appropriate considering that miramax which used place their label some the most artistically daring films has quickly become grindhouse for coddling foreign imports life beautiful and freddie prinze vehicles their company current logo could ride the trends reindeer games stars ben affleck rudy supposedly hardened criminal spending his days and nights behind bars with fantasies pecan pies dancing atop his head although affleck given some barbed wire tattoos insinuate bad assness plays the role like steve guttenberg preciously mugging through police academy flick affleck such puppy dog that impossible believe could survive harsh prison environment without becoming nearly everyone bitch the role itself badly written the character only grows balls when the plot calls for the twists outrageous and the directing self consciously gritty that this about close self parody can recall recent serious movie getting may have been wiser had the film makers simply went all the way that direction casting jerry seinfeld the hardened criminal and howard stern the sniveling bad guy who played here gary sinise yet another over the top villain performance james frain nick rudy cellmate manslaughterer who found pen pal the gorgeous ashley mason charlize theron ashley prison groupie who sends nick many cheesecake photos her though she never seen one picture him which works out fine since the character killed near riot and rudy who was paroled the same day nick takes his place which leads sudden and very frenzied sex scene between ashley and rudy frenzied kinda looks like rape and surprise visit from ashley brother gabriel gary sinise who waltzes into their shabby hotel room flanked his thuggish horts plans rob indian casino christmas eve with the assistance rudy who thinks nick who according what wrote the letters ashley used work guard the indian casino though the end the film pulls the rug out from under frequently that everything described might well irrelevant this what you can expect should you chose take this reindeer several scenes which after catching his prey the bad guy proceeds stall interminably until the good guy has chance kill his captor and crack stupid one liner included two scenes two different bad guys explaining their motives the hero when they should killing him one following the other less though action film the ending more talkfest where get the whole movie explained one flustered character actor after another while affleck looks incredulous the audience the flick was directed john frankenheimer straightforward action director who lucked into the manchurian candidate early his career fell off the list following string flops and now his old age slowly climbing his way back would success story were choosing better scripts but his last major film was ronin one those almost but not quite movies which followed the island morneau you remember the one with marlon brando mime make and not flattering moo moo and now this films action sequences with minimum quick cutting which like considering that nowadays action scenes are commonly comprised millisecond flash cuts strung together and laid out for brain zapped mtv audience pick apart problem these action scenes nearly all failed escapes serve purpose the story other than further pad out the running time and remind the audience that their watching action movie rather than filmed radio play character problems abound rudy made shift between sweet boy next door earnestness and hard edged wiseacre the latter which not least this point something ben affleck capable pulling off the former can with ease and often the actor coasts his lackadaisical charm while those around him growl and swear but then suddenly affleck starts growling and swearing alongside them like the class clown imitating tarantino gangster charlize theron extraordinary talent like affleck playing whatever part the script requires her play whether vulnerability one moment anger the next she never has chance evince any charm make much impression beyond her obvious physical attributes frankenheimer has her needlessly pop her top further italicize this gary sinise has played this role frequently and here snake eyes does the snarling bad guy thing with such over the top vitriol the guy must incredibly bored stomping through the same paces that going out control the only thing that keeps him interested any more that becomes more annoyance there goes again than threat these are talented people who made the mistake jumping script with little but stock characters and bag tricks that dully springs its audience

1 |text set the late the height yuppie excess and based the book bret easton ellis who explored the same themes another book which was also made into movie less than zero american psycho puts new spin the yuppie genre that ellis helped create christian bale perfectly cast patrick bateman high powered yuppie who hides terrible secret from his fianc and his colleagues seems that bateman serial killer and unfortunately for his contemporaries his tenuous grasp reality starting slip tries balance his meticulous daily routines with slaughtering workers and prostitutes and hiding their bodies his mental fabric slowly begins unravel was first introduced the novel when was still high school read associated press article our local sunday newspaper detailing the problems ellis was having getting his novel published due the controversial violence usual when anything controversial try seek out but soon forgot about the novel and didn end thinking about again until stumbled across couple years later bookstore picked and read but was ultimately disappointed because left more questions than answers the movie has similar effect but least less cryptic than ellis novel for once film has actually turned out better than the novel was based both the book and the film open with bateman describing his fastidious morning preparations down exactly what facial scrubs and exfoliating creams uses but the novel seems concentrate more these excesses throughout the movie continues touch upon these things but makes more point immerse bateman impending madness than detail things painstakingly the novel does result the film immensely more entertaining lions gate seems the studio champion controversial films having picked kevin smith catholic rattling dogma and here with american psycho there difference screenwriters mary harron and guinevere turner had the unenviable task trying take novel about yuppies filled with graphic violence and sex and make marketable film out some cuts had made the finished film keep from getting mainly involving sex scene comprising bateman and two women and initial reports said the film was unwatchable thankfully watchable and harron and turner have made one the most scathingly satirical films this side south park bigger longer uncut side note writer guinevere turner also makes appearance the film ill fated acquaintance bateman who after bateman suggests that she start making out with female prostitute proclaims that she not lesbian nor has any interest the ironic humor the scene stems from the fact that turner the writer director the film fish and who also assisted kevin smith with parts his script for chasing amy lesbian subtle joke and one found pretty humorous despite having rather high profile supporting cast young and comers including reese witherspoon most the roles are waste and are the equivalent extended billed cameos the real draw here christian bale and his over the top performance patrick bateman whenever read novel always try imagine what would like movie and who would perfect cast the characters always had hard time trying decide who would cast bateman but never thought bale would deliver performance perfect his ends being say bale runs away with the character vast understatement and proves that adept chewing scenery pacino rod steiger one sequence particular involving bateman describing his love for huey lewis and the news song hip square right before burying axe worker head features one the most eccentric and kinetic performances have ever seen film side note despite the fact that huey lewis hip square and pair phil collins songs appear the film don expect see them the soundtrack release huey lewis expressly requested that his song featured rather large set piece the film much akin the use stuck the middle with you reservoir dogs not included any soundtrack release assuming that collins requested the same similar note whitney houston cover the greatest love all also involved scene comparable the other two and very obvious that isn the houston version all but merely instrumental version culled from unknown source apparently houston wasn open about the use her song the others were bigger controversy than the violence and sex has been brewing since the film release that whether not patrick has actually committed the crimes have viewed during the course the film don look the book for any answers because will only serve confuse you more several web sites have been dedicated the subject but still undecided there evidence both for and against but the most scathing evidence against comes from scene near the end the film where bateman goes killing spree taking out cops old ladies and cleaning staff with equal gusto the scene seemed very dream like and absurd the action films suddenly seems parodying example bateman blows police car very cinematically after firing several shots from handgun the general direction the car kept waiting for bateman wake and for the film continue from there but bateman never does wake and the whole sequence though comic throws the film off balance which suppose was the intention other than the few flaws have mentioned american psycho incredibly entertaining film although you may not leave the movie fully understanding whether not what has just transpired actually occurred bateman reality think this movie destined for greatness cult film and deserves the spot will take such may not change anyone life but will certainly have effect know will certainly hear hip square different context the next time hear

1 |text the film magnolia can compared simple flower its title and movie poster suggests the dozens characters introduced and developed are like the petals the flower they all come from the same stem and the flower begins develop they grow farther and farther apart the numerous characters the film are all closely connected matter how different they are from one another socially from humiliated but kind cop aging game show host each one these characters suffering the same kind pain they are each seriously lonely and seek the perfect companion end this loneliness whether this companion distant family member spouse each character begs for one and spends the whole film searching for the perfect one magnolia clever well thought out film from prodigy director writer paul thomas anderson boogie nights fame the detailed character analyses and the powerful script make magnolia memorable however what really impressive that even though there are tons characters several unrelated stories the film never confusing anderson control over transitioning from one story another story masterful also knows exactly when cut another subplot since not one magnolia scenes drag too long any three hour film that does not deliver even one uninteresting scene definitely worth recommending from the fascinating beginning the risky yet surprisingly satisfying ending the film just doesn get boring obvious that anderson put lot time into connecting each subplot this the ultimate game six degrees separation every character connected every other character the most two degrees for example cop john reilly connected game show host phillip baker hall through hall daughter melora walters who once went date with reilly the fact that each character different from the others yet similar shows that there are universal pains that all classes races and genders suffer anderson explanation prove this point both accurate and convincing the only mistake anderson made trying connect his characters was making his actors all sing aimee mann song simultaneously this was foolish not only because was unbelievable and hilariously erroneous but also because had broadway musical feel and this movie about far apart from your typical broadway musical than you can get the performances magnolia are perfection this classic example flawless casting and flawless ensemble acting anderson allows many hollywood best supporting actors blossom what they best character acting all the main characters each story are perfect because they are able reveal more emotions and attitudes their brief time the screen then most movie stars can feature length film worth noting tom cruise who stepped out his usual superficial starring role and into funny but depressing tour force performance was probably noticed more than the other actors the film award givers because his role here much different and impressive than those the past however any actor this film could nominated for best supporting actor without any complaints the only problem had with the acting was that few the characters felt seriously edited down such melinda dillon character phillip baker hall wife she seemed thrown towards the end and felt very little sympathy for her because had not seen her enough earlier the film magnolia uses several effective metaphors describe its characters anderson has the talent make the audience sympathetic towards numerous people only few hours see that anderson able perfectly portray this many different types people shows that has keen sense diversity diversity what makes director successful for long period time predict lot diversity and success from anderson the future

1 |text god how many john grisham lawyer films have been munundated with perfect world civil action would breath fresh air cynical about lawyers way that grisham isn romantic the exact opposite way grisham book film isn and the capper has distinct ending and the law hollywood films that above all else you must have ending even based true story true story which hasn yet ended you must supply ending false one but ending nevertheless hell civil action even more sly and more witty than any the grisham works put together and that includes the firm the only novel his that will ever regarded classic yet also oddly and slightly unsatisfying weird this fact steve zallian film not just the work hack and zallian the director the much admired search for bobby fischer didn see and writer none other than schindler list short like this guy and sucker for the way tells his stories after all apart from the obvious holocaust film and spielberg film isn schindler list just damn brilliant film not much holocaust film wonderful character study civil action the same way narrative split between being lawyer film and being character study and here that the film seems bit wrong the main complaint this film that while yes engrossing lawyerly tale has real ending and that not necessarily the problem with the film that just kind unsatisfying this were great film would feel complete and still end basically the same way but this film just seems end and don want stupid and suggest alternate ending should tacked imagine you will being one those the film about looking forward this film and then discovered the truth has been through surrealistic and unpleasant hollywood filter just the many won bitch about what essentially genuine but the fact that just ends not all actuality what wrong with rather that zallian has chosen the last half hour adandon the traditional lawyer story and chose the other part his story the one about the lawyer one jan schlictman john travolta who shown the opening and throughout most the movie heartless but brilliant lawyer brilliant because manipulative and always wins wishes make all about jan the end but the truth his change although nicely done not full see him suffering from personal crisis and travolta does pretty good job depicting his change heart but the end don fully believe and think that the problem when has made his decision the film choses odd angle noble one but one that gives the film conclusion that incompleteness the opening the film see him doing his old schtick manipulating courts winning cases effortlessly and then discussing heard radio interview how great his job and how much cares for his cases short full bullshit and know the film takes case that hardly desired town where several the children have died mysteriously lukemia and the source the illness seems from local factory that may may not have been dumping waste into the river point one not the usual criteria jan points out wickedly that dead wounded children aren nearly sympathetic those struck down the midst their success point two has been through several lawyers after turning them down jan changes his mind muddled scene stops his car bridge looks out feeling sense overachievement and and his team lawyers tony shalhoub zeljko ivanek and accountant william macy head out the town battle with the town company they spend millions dollars examining the land test the water what have you this where stephen fry possible oscar nominee for his brilliant performance wilde pops thanklessly and the meantime question the parents the dead children and then unsuccessfully the workers the plant they also find themselves clashing with brilliant lawyer for the company the eccentric jerome facher played robert duvall more him later progress get involved the way the story being told which engulfing everything around including the individual and brief stories some the townspeople one the best bit with james gandolfini employee the plant living across the street from kathleen quinland who lost her child who begins have personal crisis things begin downhill for the lawyers the second half they are against impossible odds the judge john lithgow not only strickler but pal facher the employees the plant are either afraid loyal testify concrete evidence being found depsite the money spent find and they are quickly running out money macy mortgages everything can including their homes and their office slowly loses his sanity his meatiest role since fargo and the audience begin feel real loss hope for our protagonist fact the last half hour such change from the rest the film and unresolved that has been widely panned not being par owen gleiberman especially criticized the film for not being overly dramatic suppose like grisham novel this wouldn the change jan had not been handled the way instead having change heart and automatically being perceived good seen being still full bullshit because doesn take stock the cares his partners and causes them all lose their money and noteriaty the lawyer field because wants help the people the town instead seen being good nature but not sure how bring that out the final half tries redeem this must have been the point making this zallian mind but what follows series scenes where merely see him making personal stands for his beliefs and though has changed considerably from the opening moments when seen speeding back and forth from the town that wishes employ him and thusly receiving two speeding tickets still feel that the big change his life that not rich and esteemed anymore the film final title card witty but all actuality shallow the fault not that there closure the court case still going you know but that its personal story feels like needs either another chapter another angle the final one has need feel like the character has really made big change his life and that the story how story strife like the one the town could inspire such whopping change his personal life only feels like half that maybe even less and not travolta who does great job here though never truly memorable performance his but rather zallian whose final chapter needs rewrite then though engrossing drama one the best the year fact and one the best lawyer films period the reason because recognizes that court trial not about those being defended prosecuted but rather about the lawyers the knights who battle eachother learn that the company almost positively blame for the deaths the town but the reason can blamed because has the best prosecution you can find and duvall facher such brilliant character and does such magnificent job portraying that man that almost easy overlook how subtley great facher seen elderly man goofy eccentric carrying broken brown bag with stickers eating lunches out paper bags and making point take time out his day listen the radio and scold anyone who interupts him but look deeper and you see master work his evil and manipulative nature are hidden under the eccentricities that others don upon him and difficult hell clearly generalize him any way that why liked this film hard put pointer you can never see exactly where this film will land and even when the credits roll you still aren sure what make call the zallian effect same thing happened with schindler list not that comparing oskar schindler jan schlictman each film greatly crafted that you can help but get involved its broad storytelling interesting characters and most peculiarly the wit that comes along with only felt totally complete like say schindler list though this point may unfair make comparisons between the two might have been one the best films the year and along with that full breath fresh air

-1 |text way the gun brimming with surprises some good most bad one the good ones ryan phillippe surprisingly halfway decent performance after the actor gained much attention posing and preening through teen swill like know what you did last summer hinted bit growth last year cruel intentions with his amusingly contemptuous john malkovich meets james spader performance though his acting that film faltered around the third act mark precisely when the screenplay made his character grow heart presumably appeal his training bra wearing fans and start bellyaching about how fallen for his target was dramatic shift that neither phillippe nor the film director could negotiate but seems trying and that shouldn overlooked probably over praised seeing how this point really isn required much but look pretty here phillippe has procured five day growth beard his hair askew and his affect altered sound something like james cagney all his look here see glory tough believe pretty boy like phillippe hard ass but his performance actually helps with the illusion unlike ben affleck puppy dog approach reindeer games phillippe believable and not too bad that for the plot well that one the bad surprises phillippe and the great benicio del torro play two moronic and not even remotely likeable criminals introduced the parking lot rave where they stupidly pick fight with about twenty people who hatch scheme kidnap surrogate mother juliette lewis after overhearing that she carrying the baby painter scott wilson very well connected wealthy man the kidnapping devolves into laborious shoot out where much damage done and many are killed but the anti heroes escape with the woman while aging hit man james caan and two scheming bodyguards taye diggs and nicky katt remain pursuit directed christopher mcquarrie the screenwriter who won oscar for his work usual suspects overrated piece crime noir many circles this one included way the gun hodgepodge crime thriller motifs that just oozes eye rolling familiarity unlike phillipe mcquarrie doesn seem growing all fills his flick with sprawling labyrinth plot all snatched from movies know seen before and worse feels like the film lacks even fresh approach like what soderbergh did out sight the limey its clich all which are spewed before picture that tries desperately hip and gritty without bothering notice how common features characters living code they seemed have picked sam peckinpah 101 rather than any thing resembling life even attempts emotional weight feel strained like preposterous scene where enemies james caan and benicio del torro stop their tracks have cup coffee and pontificate life philosophy etc didn like the bit much when first appeared heat here even more self consciously dramatic usual suspects which also featured bunch low lives that seemed live code they learned from the movies worked some degree because that astonishing twist ending nowadays astonishing twist per ending rigeur never mind deems all that transpired before completely inconsequential thus nearly every character way comes with least one dirty little secret most amateurishly projected before they appear and too has ironic little twist the end nothing earth shattering like the usual suspects but admit didn see coming and smiled however most the movie feels exactly like the interrogation scenes between palminteri and spacey usual suspects lot faux huffing and puffing with rhythm reason substance just overplotted suspects and often dull any overplotted movie without interesting characters distinctive style good script would even the good stuff most which involves james caan doing fine job feels odd and out place movie that thinks lines like karma only justice with out the satisfaction are clever one point caan laments need the ultimate monkey line inexplicable might well have said love like hippo ass seen porno with better dialogue and some with better plot lines too but rarely has porn offered such talented cast mean can you even compare james caan ron jeremy caan slips into this role with seeming ease could this kind soft spoken tough guy coma but manages give his character depth and weariness benicio del torro always welcome though here plays fairly straight rather than another oddball character creation like the ones the actor gave usual suspects and excess baggage adopting brad pitt esque quizzical pout along with his heavy swaggering speaking pitt his juliette lewis weak link either shouting her lines with ear shattering shrillness waddling about like silly goose nicky katt was brilliant brief role the limey here his role just brief only seems wasted only kept around for his cold presence taye diggs has similar function cool ever but never character though the guy has one helluva death scene for the most part way incessantly talky with reason give hippo ass about any thing that transpires since its characters are never more than simplistic pawns vaguely tarantino ish but bad truth and consequences way with phillippe one scene leaping into stupid rant about faggots migrating los angeles you know the routine the final shoot out pure bargain basement john woo who himself seems doing bargain basement john woo with interchangeable bad guys lining shot but those gun shots sure crack like thunder just the other day was watching old dirty harry movie cable and was stunned hear the weak elephant grunt like sound that emanated from harry fetishized smith and wesson how far come

version dune spectacular mess and may incomprehensible those unfamiliar with the book the film visual splendour mystical beauty and impressive action scenes only partly compensate for gaping holes the narrative dune the extended version 1988 runtime 189 minutes capsule review bit throw together assembled mca special projects for cable television was disowned director david lynch but considerably closer his original vision virtue its improved characterisation and clearer storyline quality dubs this version from the out print japanese laserdisc release are available from various dealers the world wide web the review released 1984 and made then mammoth budget million the film frank herbert cult novel dune was eagerly awaited sci fans director david lynch blue velvet eraserhead twin peaks was working his biggest production date mammoth undertaking filmed under trying conditions location mexico the screenplay was lynch own chosen after the script submitted original author herbert was rejected dune set universe ruled powerful families overseen successive line emperors the key cosmic power the planet arrakis dune windswept desert planet that home giant sandworms and the precious spice melange the spice the most valuable commodity the universe extends the life and expands the consciousness those who consume most importantly allows the navigators the spacing guild once human but now hideously mutated fold space and navigate their spacecraft across mammoth distances instantaneously enabling interstellar commerce and trade flourish lynch film necessity excises parts the book while retaining the story two main strands one the long standing rivalry between two families houses atreides and house harkonnen and their battle for lucrative mining rights arrakis the second strand the emergence young paul atreides the reluctant messiah long awaited the natives arrakis the fremen the deeply religious fremen want control over their homeworld and young paul may the fulfilment their prophecy that man would come from the outer worlds and lead them freedom unfortunately this epic story unfolds confusing and haphazard manner the theatrical cut the film which runs minutes shorter than what lynch originally intended the thinking among universal wise money men was that films over two hours duration were not popular with audiences the time and would not well the box office with lynch initial cut running closer three more hours the studio demanded that further cuts made what great idea why not trim down already complex film make almost incomprehensible the most glaring consequence this one eyed stupidity hopelessly jumpy narrative leaving with badly underdeveloped characters thus their personalities are vague their motivations unclear and the case paul father duke leto their demise rather meaningless the end result distinct chill can warm most the cast and don care much for them and hardly helps that the voice over narration sparse and that the dune esque language and terminology sounds like much gobbledegook those unfamiliar with the book dune also very serous film the constant self talk various characters makes serious and self absorbed times that you may find hard not wince with embarrassment the overall impression world full people intense that one allowed joke lest the universe come crashing down around them humour least gentle kind humour distinct from the harkonnen mad sadistic kind hard find you may balk the comparison but writer lynch could well have done with some lessons from george lucus star wars trilogy the theatrical version still some way from being complete disaster however still possesses enough lynch stylistic quirks and enough visual invention sustain the interest viewers with taste for imaginative sci special effects whiz carlo rambaldi giant sandworms are awesome sight both the production design anthony masters and costume design bob ringwood are striking and original and the magnificent score toto and brian eno one the most underrated soundtracks the last twenty years with these elements place and the benefit freddie francis lush cinematography the film least feast for the senses see the widescreen format you can and despite all the cuts several cast members still make strong impression most notably kenneth mcmillan the supremely nasty baron vladimir harkonnen sian phillips also registers strongly the reverend mother gaius helen mohiam leader the bene gesserit religious order who secret aim manipulate paul destiny for its own shadowy ends paul atreides the young kyle maclachlan starts off somewhat shakily but his character grows strength does his performance and emerges credible leader the fremen crusade the conclusion any assessment this film must take into account that frank herbert original novel complex piece work and presents tough challenge for any filmmaker david lynch took brave stab and partly due forces beyond his control ended with officially released version that fails several key respects dune certainly confused and frustrated lot people its release many chose stay away altogether the film disastrous box office showing attests the extended version however rather different beast 1984 lynch stated his intention release his own special edition director cut the film home video clear indication his dissatisfaction with the version that ended the theatres but alas failed choosing move other projects way then partly lynch own fault that what appeared instead was unauthorised extended version put together 1988 mca special projects for airing cable networks the usa stung into action lynch successfully petitioned the director guild take his name off the credits and replace with allen smithee the standard pseudonym for directors who wish disown their own work also had the screenwriting credit changed the anonymous judas booth certainly looking the results mca handiwork there least half dozen instances that for sheer technical sloppiness are good enough reasons for the director object but these gripes must considered light the improvements that the extended cut dune offers several crucial areas most the changes involve the restoration extension cut scenes and the addition extra narration both which fill many holes the original version storyline paul relationship with his father and associates more intimate with moments humour and warmth lacking previously the political skulduggery involving the emperor the spacing guild the bene gesserits and the two warring houses far better explained paul initiation into the fremen way life arrakis also fleshed out considerably and further background new prologue has been added featuring narration and painted stills give brief history the dune universe piece storytelling then mca version dune clearly superior piece editing however times surprisingly inept the use painted stills the new prologue works well enough but their occasional appearance once the action begins inappropriate there some sloppy cutting too and few instances shots even appear out order and the use repeated footage fabricate certain scenes ships coming and going soldiers coming and going times clearly out context this the kind thing which lynch objected and rightly should also noted that several questionable scenes and shots from the theatrical version were deleted satisfy the censorship demands television but the most notable omission gratuitous piece nonsense from lynch that wasn even herbert book the scene features baron harkonnen killing beautiful young man front his slobbering henchmen pulling out his heart plug its surreal and disturbing episode that very lynch esque but adds nothing what already know the baron nasty piece work despite its own peculiar flaws then the extended version dune generally superior film all contains minutes restored footage and approximately another minutes either altered fabricated newly created sequences unless the idiosyncratic lynch has sudden change heart the alan smithee version remains the closest get what the movie should have been repeated viewings one suspects closer than what lynch would prepared admit still one this century great science fiction novels some fans and perhaps the late herbert himself would argue that dune deserved better fate its transfer the screen with rumours circulating new six hour mini series planned production company new amsterdam entertainment 1998 unlikely that have heard the last the dune saga

1 |text andrew lloyd webber musicals preferably his early work with lyricist tim rice present musical which totally unlike any musical before its time webber and rice not subscribe the gaity such musicals oklahoma the slapstickness shows like funny thing happened the way the forum they instead tackle hot issues from our past and view them differently and pack them together with redundant catchy music well thoughtful lyrics like jesus christ superstar which examined the rise and fall jesus his last days from fame perspective the cool tune superstar dead judas comes back from the dead ask jesus why didn spread his message wider evita takes inventive stance its topic this time being the famed wife argentinian dictator juan per eva who slept her way the top and became famous chiefly because she got attention much like the woman playing her madonna although think madonna did rise the top for her musical talent among other things evita deals with the rise and fall eva per woman who captured the heart the nation after marrying juan jonathan pryce then died the young age creating international stir mourning not unlike that princess the two share bit common although wasn like slept the top webber and rice sure chose bizarre topics for their musicals but they always have point for doing here they wish expose her for what she but still show that despite all her many drawbacks her lying and covering for her fascist husband but show that she was still good woman with fairly good intentions and her death was very sad also musical with almost words not unsung the film plays like rock opera much like their jesus christ superstar with many giant musical sequences just like the old musicals even they possess very intelligent lyrics which create not only intellectually enlightening experience but also very entertaining one after all this musical and webber musicals never undermine this they are balance energy and intellectual depth walking fine line between the both and never stumbling either side this why the beginning evita kind let down okay let down not saying the opening moments are bad because they pretty good but what comes after lifeless entertaining and totally unrewarding sequence where she cons singer jimmy nail into taking eva buenos aires after one night stand the musical fun energetic sequence culiminating the show stopper buenos aires which also lifeless then punch pulled see eva being screwed over the singer instead her leaving him where she ends singing the sad tune another suitcase another hall which was meant for later character screwed over eva the portrayal eva the beginning too soft seeming like parker and oliver stone who adapted for the screen are afraid present her for what she even while being narrated hater eva the omnipotent antonio banderas who presents her negative light for while looks like alan parker can pull off however the film pulls itself together flash and after that song over and the giddily nihilistic song goodbye and thank you where see eva through long line lovers who help her ascend magnificent darkly comical and just gleeful from this point the film hypnotic satisfying and satirical more punches are thrown and the basic outline the original musical are tact see eva woo and marry juan get him out jail rise stardom falter bit come back and then gradually die cancer think was because cancer more importantly many the themes from the musical carry with this well some filling the gaps reconnassaince work juan who pretty underwritten the musical given some extra scenes and exposed what was for eva accessory muted scene where tries visit her respective room but shunned allows learn more about juan and understand his sadness more than did before from the goodbye and thank you number the film shows eva trying cover for the horrible government doing cheap and petty things which wooed nation and saved government even while left the nation people downtrodden but despite this the nation still loved eva and when she slipped into death the world mourned her because she was star that when our narrator comes out show that she wasn the great woman she really was and expose her fame describing this character difficult mainly because has real realistic background said based the revolutionary guevera but the two probably could have never met like they the film but serves perspective eva but even his perspective can help from feeling bad when eva dies pathetic death alan parker stranger bizarre musicals done fame the committments bugsy malone and pink floyd the wall the latter which absolutely brilliant nails the film exposing everything for what cry for evita the end because feel should the way presented his direction manipulative for reason show the mourning for what and there energy throughout with lots bright colors and scenes which are cinematically entertaning well enriching and deep such the balcony scene where she sings don cry for argentina and her death sequence which poignant becuase how sad madonna golden globe winning performance much like the movie starts kinda downhill then goes quickly remaning there for the rest the film the beginning she looks like she too busy concentrating her singing act but she eventually gets right though never really getting the presence say patti lupone who did the role its american premiere back the late 70s her death though brilliant her singing could better though know she took lessons improve her range and all but still sounds like she trying hard she sounds way too soft several places where she should comanding like patti lupone heard her sing old evita and you could just feel her stage presence without even seeing her but generally very good although not the brilliance the role really requires antonio banderas who almost like guilty pleasure these days one the few people who thinks rocks extremely comanding his performance presenting lovable narrator his singing very good though nothing compared the original mandy patinkin does have pretty good singing voice and great range and jonathan pryce pretty awesome although very brief times his role juan seeming put poker face for his melancholy facade although gets off rocky start rocky polite for what really soon picks and becomes wonderully poignant musical like the other musical released woody allen everyone says love you reminder that the hollywood musical may dead but can come back every now and then for brief performance

original them all has been the matrix all the films released after have been less successful david cronenberg existenz released only couple months after the matrix was accepted and even appreciated some but the hype was gone and when the thirteenth floor aired this fall was completely overseen and ignored admit that this issue has become something between tiring and annoying feeling like eating the same meal over and over again was therefore was less than excited when went out see the thirteenth floor however was positively surprised josef rusnak latest picture matrix was entertaining thrill ride through dreams and reality combining the best hollywood action and effects with intelligent story existenz was violent gory and unsettling journey through reality and virtual reality ending blood and madness the thirteenth floor somewhere between instead going after the crowds the action audience like the matrix aiming the horror fans like existenz the thirteenth floor presents more

that all the people the simulation the program links are living out their lives oblivious not knowing that they are puppets someone fantasy with appealing blade runner type detective story this film presents the beauty and possibilities virtual reality and the lurking danger that always present our modern world metal and glass cold unfriendly impersonal the thirties are different colorful

hopes dreams and fantasies life least that how all beginning but when you waking from your dream the real world seems worthless and unreal and all you can think off returning your personal paradise this almost narcotic effect soon turns into confusion and ultimately madness some important and interesting philosophical questions are raised what real what thought who are these were answered this film would the greatest science fiction ever made they are off course not answered but posed intelligent manner the visual aspect the film one the key elements since portrays the contrast between these computer simulated universes kirk petrucelli has done marvelous job with the recreation the thirties with its glamour grace and color and setting this world opposition our own almost caricatured recreation the nineties there are some honest and decent performances almost unknown cast and harald klose moody musical score that right place the right time rather unusual thing about the thirteenth floor the almost complete lack special effects there are cgi animated creatures bullets slow motion this more philosophical approach reminding about the european way filmmaking this off course major disappointment the audience that used endless gunfights and mutated amphibians but the more serious science fiction buffs and dark city fans will pleased this film interesting and inspiring has everything existenz doesn but lacks the immediacy and intensity the matrix and then there happy end which like dark city completely alienates from the rest the story and context the plot itself not original the filmmakers want think since they have virtually sucked out all information from the best science fiction classics including blade runner and dark city with this mind the thirteenth floor

1 |text known the most successful highest grossing romantic comedy history director garry marshall apparently struck gold with pretty woman which opened quietly during the summer 1990 but thanks positive word mouth was able reach upwards 175 million theaters alone the question why worked well lies directly with the film two charismatic stars richard gere and julia roberts since the story itself none too original even believable the other winning element that makes pretty woman entertaining its genuine sweetness and innocence which rarely palpable today films here edward lewis richard gere suave extremely wealthy business mogul who the start the picture breaks with his girlfriend over the phone after nasty argument and abruptly takes his friend car and gets lost hollywood boulevard while trying find his hotel stopping the car along the street asks woman obviously prostitute for directions agreeing get his car and show him for ten bucks edward ultimately accepts they strike conversation and before long she has been asked his penthouse room the top floor this meeting does not lead sex however edward confides that rather just have someone talk and offers her 300 spend the night just well since the hooker named vivian beautiful generally upbeat young woman who the type person that can lend understanding ear the meeting between these two completely opposite people does not end the next morning planned when edward finally offers pay vivian three thousand dollars she will stay with him for six days and nights while the area keeping him company and acting his companion business dinners and get togethers since vivian firmly tells edward the beginning that she will anything with him except kiss him the lips which always leads unwanted intimacy when dealing with her customers the obligatory rule the genre says that the third act edward and vivian will finally truly kiss allegedly planned grim downbeat drama until garry marshall came board director pretty woman has been transformed all senses the word into classic fairy tale cinderella the premise hardly believable and its portrait prostitutes hanging out the streets hollywood boulevard just about the most idealized portrayal that there could have possibly been you honestly don need high any for that matter guess how the film will end and the story old great great grandma bertha the supporting characters are almost all sketchily written and less than gratifying and the screenplay award winner and yet amidst all these qualms and flaws pretty woman astoundingly charming motion picture and definately easy see why became such overnight sensation with moviegoers you actually amazed how far bemusement can and there are few select moments not even whole scenes mind you that are romantic anything seen film the 1990 additionally the film belongs and its success can attributed two people and two people only and they are richard gere and julia roberts playing sex symbols throughout the 80s with such pictures american gigolo and officer and gentleman gere branches out here play more quiet almost shy but still alluring character that believably could sweep julia roberts off her feet and vice versa julia roberts her breakthrough role after 1988 well received mistic pizza and 1989 steel magnolia for which she was nominated for academy award radiant and funny the wordly vivian who surprisingly could role model for impressionistic viewers not for her line work but more for her sheer intelligence would have probably been easy have written vivian merely flake but screenwriter lawton clearly cared too much about his central characters such thing after pretty woman roberts along with meg ryan became the reigning queen romantic comedies with her latest being the just released runaway bride which repairs gere and roberts together once again and wonder roberts has continually proven not only strong actress with flare for comedy but also one who can efficiently drama and almost every film she appears difficult not fall love with her along with her male star especially strong scene that gere and roberts together takes place after edward foolishly tells one his workers that vivian actually prostitute and then approaches her making sexual advances only does this make vivian feel cheap especially since she had previously been posing more professional eloquent young lady but also maddens her that edward would demean and betray her such way and ultimately causes her question where exactly her life leading and she likes this particular path the more dreamy side the film filled with romantic scenes that are simply effervescent behold especially one which edward enters into the hotel lounge see vivian turn around and not only reveal her marvelous cocktail dress but also her inner and outer glowing beauty another subtle moment has vivian lovingly blowing kiss edward who asleep and placing his lips since she still unsure she should getting attached this man who may very well out her life forever short couple days pretty woman does not blatantly step wrong until the very last scene which happy ending you expect and wouldn have any other way that somehow does not work perhaps because its undeniable contrivances this one misstep does not put damper the rest the film though because there just far too much magic work here disaffirm such petty problem helped along warm memorable supporting performance from laura san giacomo vivian best friend and roommate and fabulously catchy soundtrack which all the songs prominently aid the movie overall fulfillment pretty woman sparkler motion picture and has what takes act blueprint how make the quintessential romantic comedy

meantime experience the rejuvenating qualities the homeworld worf grows pimple data sings opera pieces picard scores with chick riker shaves while sharing bubblebath with troi and the enterprise women note their firmer breasts comments star trek the next generation was hugely successful sequel series star trek science fiction series which developed devoted fan following the 1970s even though still enjoyed high ratings star trek the next generation ended production after seven years that the cast could replace the original star trek cast paramount film franchise centering the voyages the starship enterprise star trek insurrection the ninth star trek movie and the third focus the star trek the next generation crew star trek insurrection qualifies one those movies star trek fans such myself would rate somewhere between okay and good after star trek the final frontier nearly awful movie almost bad the repugnant star trek voyager series star trek fans could probably swallow anything paramount throws out the trek film franchise don wish spend this review comparing insurrection the eight other trek movies most people reading this probably haven followed star trek anyway comparison would seem tedious best let thus make comparisons briefly that out system star trek insurrection not good the previous installment star trek first contact star trek insurrection comic tone may best compared star trek the voyage home star trek the wrath khan still the best trek movie okay let move the movie itself star trek insurrection infuses basic science fiction premise humanity exploration and colonization space with lot lowbrow humor and witty oneliners this combination works well more often than fails but when does fail the humor really seems cheesy much this film appeals trek fans nostalgic fondness for the starship enterprise crew audiences unfamiliar with trek lore may miss the significance some plot points and may even become confused times star trek insurrection begins with scenes the tranquil life the homeworld forget the actors and special effects the beautiful setting this movie with its snowy mountaintops and verdant valleys steals the show this tranquility however broken data android who reveals the that they are being secretly monitored the federation and their alien allies the son seems that this world veritable fountain youth sustaining its inhabitants indefinantly young healthy state the enterprise crew led captain picard investigates data actions and uncovers conspiracy between the son and enterprise admiral relocate the and plunder the planet youth restoring properties sound pretty heavy though this plot anything but unique and groundbreaking undermined the film constant barrage humor when going after data for instance picard sings opera piece with him this supposed cute and humorous much more funny sequence work grows large pimple the side his nose result his exposure the homeworld pimple which his crewmates try they might cannot avoid looking the acting star trek insurrection for the most part pretty good since they been playing these characters for years those portraying the enterprise crew reassume their roles effortlessly enough the terrific actor patrick stewart plays captain jean luc picard and delivers moral speech picard trademark with his usual aplomb brent spiner another fine actor plays the android data well enough again and provides the best moments comic relief the film though the old android wishing human motif will tire some trek fans familiar with the routine from the series the supporting cast who appear this movie alone are also pretty good despite many other critics negative opinions murray abraham the winner academy award for his performance amadeus plays the major villain afro well enough afro reminds somewhat the baron harkonnen the 1984 film version dune like the baron afro continuously has his skin looked after stretched and stapled servants one particularly memorable scene afro becomes very agitated and his facial skin splits open and bleeds afro khan from star trek the best trek villain ever but much better than the forgettable soran from star trek generations okay promise more comparisons donna murphy must also noted woman anij who picard falls love with murphy not young woman with supermodel body she mature woman with attractive countenance this the type woman whom picard for those who know the character well would enchanted with fact the chemistry between murphy and stewart works very well here particular plot point involving anij ability slow time down ability which she shares with picard becomes one the most intriguing parts the movie for good the actors and setting were star trek insurrection special effects were surprisingly disappointing they proved adequate sometimes barely for 1990s mainstream science fiction film but they fell way short the standard trek movie and paled comparison those seen the trailer for star wars the phantom menace trailer which reportedly preceded many showings insurrection the space battles involving the enterprise and sona ships particular seemed trite and unsuspenseful and the final confrontation between picard and afro took place completely unconvincing interior satellite the new enterprise itself only seen this film and its predecessor remains largely unexplored though its exterior doesn look quite right for reason cannot explain despite star trek insurrection frequent comic goofiness and occasional substandard special effects enjoyed the film maintains roddenberry largely optimistic view the future and rejects the gritty violence its predecessors particularly star trek first contact though don get wrong the dark tones trek films like first contact can work very successfully recommend insurrection matinee film for saturday afternoon especially for fans trek science fiction general rated can see this film being objectionable the viewing audience young old

before the beginning watchers reborn they awful these commercials cover films like strange stripper movie called shadow dancer some weird crap about dead indian teens and wolves and action movie called detonator starring scott baio scott baio what idiot dreamed this movie after surviving these abysmal trailers the person finally gets watch the movie rented watchers reborn maybe won that bad may say himself perhaps just perhaps the bottom the barrel film fluff advertised before greatly misleading watchers reborn after all based that cool book dean koontz wrote decade ago stars mark hamill luke skywalker himself from that terrific star wars trilogy lou rawls even the mix unfortunately the force certainly longer with mark hamill looks very sick here and this movie shares only basic plot elements with watchers the book the latter really too bad koontz hack writer producing way too many thrillers for his own good but still favorite hack writer koontz has writing style which succinct and suspenseful people who read many his books however often complain repetitive plot devices definately not koontz book there isn psychic super intelligent dog psychotic killer who likes ripping out people eyeballs watchers has all three devices which may explain why arguably the most popular koontz books the idea behind koontz novel though highly implausible very interesting basically biological war machine created smart dog can released battle track down its target and then relay the target position psychically large creature designed kill hand hand combat silly but kind neat too sorry don mean ramble about matters not directly linked watchers reborn the movie suppose just don want talk about the movie itself this turkey really cheesy one this movie can act including mark hamill and difficult seeing the aged luke skywalker stumble around trying the hero the cheese factor only increased when involved implied sex scene with the blond biologist geneticist zoologist whatever the she supposed whom befriends mercifully the filmmakers opted not nudity honest the only half convincing actor the film the golden retriever who plays einstein you know movie bad when dog outacts all its human counterparts find difficult relate how laughable the action sequences are this movie and the creature yes the creature out after poor einstein some guy furry suit and mask which poorly imitates the werewolves the howling this creature shot about 500 000 times but okay the creature has the ability kill people swinging his arms around and pushing can also rip body parts off allowing for many scenes fake hands and arms being thrown around cheesy gore that another main element watchers reborn has many bloody scenes which are thoroughly unconvincing and only increase the film campiness rather than its suspense ultimately gave watchers reborn star and half because bad horror sci film buffs may get few kicks out the film silliness though this film will tax even their patience minute film but feels like four hours also hate admit have survived far worse than this anyone who has sat through the christopher lambert and natasha henstridge debacle known adrenalin fear the rush will know what mean finally couldn help but think that watchers reborn would work well bot fodder for the creative folks behind one all time favorite shows mystery science theater 3000 this thought alone helped survive watchers reborn with smile face rated watchers reborn contains dozens blood spattered bodies and unconvincing gore also has violence obviously wouldn recommend for the little kids but sure even young teens would make through this movie okay instead watching this film however recommend reading koontz book trust time much much better spent
1 |text let first say that the conditions that was forced watch the matrix under were less than ideal have tried fair possible considering that viewing experience was significantly less than ideal watched the matrix theater that serious need upgrades the best times under circumstances should have ever been allowed show big budget special effects laden film like the matrix this theater owned the parent company one hollywood biggest studios hasn even graduated into stereo sound yet the mono sound that the audience was subjected sounded was coming out speaker that was many years past mandatory retirement age other words the sound sucked someone used digital sound movie theater bad sound doesn anything add film not even going into the horrible splicing job that the projectionist did putting this film together there had rant now with the regularly scheduled review which sadly won include commentary the film sound which assuming was spectacular but just guessing guess the sound seems like fairly solid one considering the visual quality the matrix nothing short stunning visually sadly the rest the film while pretty good doesn quite measure the obvious effort that was expended making this film look darn good the matrix has core good concept although strays into the confusing side more often than would have liked keanu reeves plays computer hacker who drawn into the frightening realization that reality just hoax turns out that that many years ago the world was devastated some sort disaster now machines run the planet and humans spend their lives sort incubator plugged into computer network the computers are generating virtual reality world which representation the earth before was destroyed the population the planet never realizes that their entire life hoax and that they really spend their entire lives comatose that except small band who have discovered this horrible secret and have escaped their virtual prisons they now spend their lives combating the computers effort expose this lie reeve character neo recruited this band rebels led morpheus laurence fishburne newcomer carrie anne moss and one hollywood most underrated actors joe pantoliano join fishburne the band freedom fighters the action sequences are nothing short spectacular this can attributed much the amazing special effects many the actor extensive pre production training martial arts this lends itself some the best martial arts sequences that you are ever likely see film when you add this some the wild effects the computer generated world all adds eyeful already said the visuals far outpace the rest the film acting the matrix not bad but certainly isn real good either keanu reeves gives his usual fairly emotionless performances although his credit one his better performances laurence fishburne the other hand often seemed forget that was sci action film more than few times delivered his lines thought was performing some sort shakespearean drama joe pantoliano was little under used this film but made the most with what had carrie anne moss turned out surprisingly good performance for this her first feature film role nice see that she was cast much for her talent for her breathtaking looks you have give all the main actors healthy dose credit for the work that they obviously put into the physical training for their roles this film was clear that small effort went into getting the moves down perfectly for the fighting sequences also put much the blame for the somewhat strained performances the matrix the dialogue which was terrible times more than few places got way too existential for liking and other times was just plain weird almost seems though the writers were having difficult time trying figure out how explain the concept for the movie they decided make the dialogue obtuse possible that one could figure out what the heck they were talking about thereby covering any leaps faith that they may have had make the departments logic and believability other major complaint with the matrix was with the very unsatisfying ending the setup for was hokey and frankly used many bad film before the ending itself was just plain strange the main reasons recommend the matrix are the visual effects and computer animation which make this real treat watch while the rest the film acting dialogue and degree plot detract from the high production values they don detract enough prevent from recommending the matrix fun way spend evening
-1 |text there was probably good reason that the warner bros studio chose not allow critics view this steven seagal film when first opened and after seeing this piece toxic waste now know why this movie far the worst offering that has hit the screen since possibly those ernest movies years ago fire down below centers its story little mining town god country somewhere eastern kentucky beauty and natural goodness being slowly destroyed uncaring mining magnate kris kristopherson who constantly looks like wants kill his agent for getting him this role turns out that filling the mines throughout kentucky with toxic waste for tidy profit seagal plays jack taggert aikido versed fighting machine who agent with the epa not the cia nor the fbi nor the nsa the environmental protection agency had idea that epa agents were trained killers taggert sent find the perpetrators and bring them justice written someone named jeb could already envision the stereotypes incestuous relationships banjo picking preachers and dumb nails rednecks but the script puts seagal right smack dab the middle all these scenarios tries discreetly fit seagal idea disguise long length 1000 leather jacket but get closer the kinfolk will fix people porches for free that another great epa asset teaching agents how fix porches slow and plodding this project total mess the sometimes allure watching seagal watching him outmaneuver enemies that outnumber and outgun him like under seige here his bravado basically turns into bullyness townsfolk who are foolish enough challenge seagal are quickly subdued fight scenes are quick and senseless and offers enjoyment value whatsoever and his soap box message wears thin within the first minutes the most annoying moment comes when barges into the middle sunday church ceremony gets behind the pulpit and beseeches the townsfolk take control their lives and help clean the environment but the epitome how moralistically mushy this film gets happens when the person responsible for the toxic dumping kristopherson meets with seagal kristopherson asks seagal how much will take for him away seagal gallantly replies leave when you take the poison from the streams and the earth was expecting patriotic music start blasting and show fireworks the background this truly nothing more than pompous showcase for seagal righteousness and narcissistic arrogance seagal has been vanguard trying bring new genre into the filmplace that the enviro thriller deadly ground however the message will never come across through poorly developed vehicles like this still believe preserving mother earth save your and please donate instead some worthy environmentally conscious charity

1 |text with the exception their surrealistic satire barton fink the films joel and ethan coen fit into two broad categories quirky and sometimes darkly humorous takes the film noir genre which crime schemes wrong and spin increasingly out control fargo miller crossing blood simple and off the wall comedies centered around eccentric scatter brained lead character raising arizona the hudsucker proxy their latest offering the big lebowski falls within the latter category though there are elements the crime gone wrong theme and even touch satire found this film the main difference however that while the protagonists raising arizona and the hudsucker proxy had lofty aspirations and ideals but didn quite have the brains get all together the main character the big lebowski seems like fairly intelligent guy who wise the world but doesn really want much anything besides bowling smoke pot and generally relax that main character jeffrey the dude lebowski jeff bridges introduced the film rambling narrator sam elliott quite possibly the laziest man los angeles county the dude unemployed needless say and spends most his time the bowling alley with his two best friends walter john goodman borderline psychotic who the habit pulling gun when thinks somebody cheating bowling match has the whole world gone crazy shouts suspected cheater and donny steve buscemi who always few steps behind the conversation and constantly berated walter for donny you have frame reference here these three seem more less live for bowling tournaments and the film begins they are anticipating important match with rival bowler jesus quintana john turturro who when first meet him doing dance the bowling lane accompany spanish version hotel california and possible seems even more head case than walter that doesn give you good idea this film absurdist tone then perhaps this will the entire scenario which drives the story set motion two thugs mistakenly urinating the dude rug they mistaken him for millionaire the same name who also known the big lebowski david huddleston and whose nymphomaniac wife bunny tara reid owes money porn producer jackie treehorn ben gazzara the dude goes the big lebowski seeking compensation for his ruined rug doesn have any luck but when bunny apparently kidnapped the elder lebowski asks him deliver the million ransom unfortunately walter gets involved and fouls the drop off and before they can try again get the money the supposed kidnappers the dude car gets stolen along with the briefcase containing the money soon the dude being harassed not only the big lebowski himself but also treehorn and group german nihilists who demand the ransom money even though they may not have been involved the kidnapping the first place the dude and walter suspect that bunny may well have kidnapped herself order extort money from her husband repay her debts treehorn meanwhile the big lebowski daughter maude julianne moore feminist avant garde artist who likes make grand entrances swinging through the air naked wants recover the money for her family the plot however really just vehicle for all these bizarre characters run wild and wreak their own unique forms havoc the previews for the big lebowski feature creedence clearwater revival run through the jungle and fits the coens see los angeles veritable jungle oddballs and nutcases with the sometimes bewildered dude left run through and try avoid any more trouble usually unsuccessfully the film doesn feature quite many one liners and sight gags the coens other comedies though there are few hilarious moments visual humor particularly the dude dream sequences and acid flashbacks but more than makes for with the sheer fun watching these strange characters interact the film sometimes seems little disjointed result you get the feeling that the coens have not only set their characters loose this jungle but are also themselves running crazy through the jungle their own twisted imaginations but for the most part the characterizations are interesting enough overcome the shaky plotting and what turns out somewhat anticlimactic resolution there also noticeable but not too heavy handed thread social commentary the big lebowski which incidentally takes place just the gulf war about begin the beginning see george bush television making his this aggression will not stand speech the coens take aim just about every elite subculture the book the egotistical wealthy businessman the bums will always lose shouts the big lebowski one point the porn industry the overbearing malibu policeman who berates the dude for disturbing their peaceful beach community and the end really start admire the dude who almost certainly harbors the least aggression anyone this story his passive resistance emphasis passive albeit the elite emerges something more than just another quirky characterization film overflowing with quirky characters also turns out have pretty well functioning brain his head even doesn like use very much his sarcasm towards treehorn and the malibu policeman shows that knows when getting run around and does manage unravel the kidnapping mystery the end the coens certainly poke fun the dude for his laziness but they don just treat him fodder for cheap shots either think that more than anything what makes the big lebowski standout comedy manages approach characters like the dude and some extent walter with genuine affection while still acknowledging that they are pretty scatter brained audience members may find themselves surprised how much they like the dynamic duo the end the movie given that they seemed like nothing more than the butts extended joke first good knowin out there the dude takin easy posits the narrator towards the end dare say that truer words have seldom been spoken

thinking that the end the conflict what really wants takes pretty smart person that but what the hostage holding criminal just smart what also able think his feet fact what also knows all the tricks

murder faced with the scorn most the police department and under close scrutiny the media roman forced turn his badge one those typical scenes the captain office don quite remember the captain actually said hate this but although wouldn surprise did luckily the film soon shakes off the conventionalism and concentrates the interesting premise mentioned above after being offered take leave deal the district attorney roman resolves prove his innocence walking into the office internal affairs inspector niebaum walsh taking him and others hostage and proclaiming has been framed although roman actions seem forced due the compressed nature his motivational build gray redeems himself involving with the negotiations between roman and fellow police negotiator chris sabian kevin spacey which soon ensue jackson while superb actor miscast the role roman the actor has become popular and often identified protagonist notable exceptions can found such jackie brown that audience have difficult time believing will carry out his threats the script also clearly sets him the good guy who only trying prove his innocence how can believe going shoot hostage matter the hostage tried kill him earlier unfortunately this preconception saps the film some would suspenseful moments and anything good left those scenes largely attributed jackson acting ability almost every time scene jackson steals without looking back when spacey appears the film has already run about third its course his interesting character made out some kind negotiating superman our first look him has him hopelessly trying get his family moving set out vacation can talk man out blowing the sears tower but can talk wife out the bedroom daughter off the phone says when gets the call action however quickly changes gears and becomes the man expect him soon his character has negotiate not only with roman but also with the swat commander david morse who itching send team take roman out all the while keeping wary the fbi agents who are waiting take over the operation should negotiations fail this complex set pressures are reflected well sabian the negotiator and spacey the actor the second protagonist spacey measures nicely gray really lucked out with this cast david morse commander beck ron rifkin commander frost and john spencer police chief travis are all more than competent and can hold their own scenes with jackson and spacey the only problem the bit typecasting that results from these choices morse played similar role the rock rifkin played the confidential and spencer played police detective cop land with the level acting however this can forgiven also the supporting cast paul giamatti rudy one the hostages notable for the comic relief provides his character initially slimy and giamatti himself just looks shifty that you expect laugh before even says anything fortunately this doesn distract from the seriousness the rest the film but instead provides some nice breathers from the level tension which gray manages sustain throughout walsh the suspicious internal affairs inspector clocks with one his final performances sadly the talented but underrated actor passed away late february this year and the soon released pleasantville will mark his last film walsh appeared dozens movies such good morning vietnam backdraft and nixon for one his best performances check out sling blade which plays mental patient sharing ward with billy bob thornton when jack nicholson accepted his best actor oscar march walsh was one the men whom credited his success the actors performed together few good men the negotiator actually dedicated walsh and while inspector niebaum may not have been his best role certainly characterizes the type character for which walsh had become most

idiotic society can then apologize for being harsh elements his film but presented mean spiritedly that can help but feel like had some serious intent for the entire central theme the movie afraid that one that just don get tried keep open mind while watching but the homosexual elements were just too prevalent for tastes was hard enough watch them bash other races and sexes without them preaching about the virtues being homosexual and accepted society how does one expect accepted they are just guilty non acceptance not prone judging anyone and believe that people should free explore whatever avenues they wish free from the scornful eye society but don force your particular rhetoric down throat you aren going show the same respect for preferences that you wish from again maybe missing the satirical point that harmon trying make but think could have been handled little more tactfully far musical comedies isle lesbos trey parker and matt stone musical but good portion the songs are maddeningly catchy despite the disturbing visuals mom and apple pie stuck with for the rest the day speaking disturbing visuals wedding bells ain ringing could have been decent song but the accompanying visuals spousal abuse are more harrowing than this film should displaying lesbian which touted the press release being particularly popular also pretty good but good portion that could due the stellar singing voice smith mainly her excellent vocals that rating this film based the other performers are decent save for the rosie donnell like performance given danica sheridan have inherent problem with her character just her singing voice that leaves little desired one particular musical number lesbian rock was one the lowest points have ever experienced film going life thanks strained and lackluster vocal job sheridan the film ends about twenty minutes before the credits actually roll the remainder the running time padded out with few more songs lesbian rock included and the ridiculously presented anti nukes message tacked the end for reason other than make feature length film once the isle lesbos reprise was reached felt the story had already been wrapped well enough end all why was the film needlessly stretched out past its obvious end isle lesbos available videocassette from www indie underground com the transfer pretty clean and all the detail the wrinkled cloth and paint backdrops are readily apparent and the film letterboxed approximately many respects isle lesbos has incredible cult potential like rocky horror for the new millennium this film means cup tea but know there are those out there who will enjoy you think might for you then all means seek out the other hand will cleansing palette with good action film like gladiator wait aren gladiator films considered never mind

-1 |text when critics attack seemingly well intentioned films like patch adams more recently pay forward about their opinions are often greeted with backlash angry mails sometimes even mock death threats from those who suppose like shamelessly manipulated their entertainment even politicians tend dismiss film critics heartless cynics for occasionally dumping good hearted films while praising filth like pulp fiction these fill the derogatory term that you are comfortable with tend forget that film critic job review the movie not the message however sweet and endearing that message may thusly patch adams isn bad film because about doctor who cares for his patients bad film because calculated piece brazen audience exploitation similarly while pay forward may have its heart the right place though even doubt that stay tuned explanation forthcoming still unpleasantly maudlin mess the picture about emotionally guarded 5th grade history teacher somewhat similarly guarded kevin spacey with burn scared face and equally singed attitude who gives his class the seemingly impossible assignment doing one thing over the course the semester that will change the world year old trevor haley

the same for three others and before long all living frank capra movie meanwhile parallel story weasely reporter jay mohr tracks the movement which has apparently begun grow pay forward has odd ideas about tone certain points hurls smattering unnecessary cynicism that would the appropriate antidote the unrelenting sappiness its core director mimi leder didn have the confidence make pay forward the way she intended and compromised out fear that her film wasn gutsy enough earn the acclaim has clearly been made for the picture adds grit child molester propositions trevor homeless man returns heroin after being saved character knifed while doing good deed etc though seems shallow incorporated into the proceedings because the film itself isn quite sure ready buy into its own utopian blather pay forward offers crowd pleasing elements for general audiences jay mohr umpteenth variation the waspy sleazeball angie dickinson earthy alcoholic bag woman and the jive talking black hoodlum with heart gold coming the heals the black god like inmate embodied gabriel casseus bedazzled this may just the beginnings brand new guilty white liberal clich hurray for hollywood who actually calls the mohr character nigga and says things like can you feel leave pay forward happily include little minstrel act for our further enjoyment maybe spike flick wasn misguided after all these scenes feel they belong dopey comedy with feel good aspirations rather than the irritatingly saccharine drama that you find yourself trapped should you not heed warnings while the filmmakers have stressed interviews that they actually hope this film that could make the world better place the final product has the oily feel cynical politician contemptuously reciting cookie fortune slogans hopeful audience picture that looks tailor made for academy consideration with the main players all previous oscar winners nominees given big emotional scenes that are practically variations their most lauded turns one scene which slightly glamed helen hunt glamed here means that not only she fashion victim her look somewhere between goth queen and trailer park mama hunt hair also natty and badly bleached verbally castigates spacey feels right out her good gets oscar clip spacey course responds his cultured monotone that could straight from his low key american beauty performance maybe the actor should get award for coming off the least self consciously irritating though how can not even when emoting spacey seems somehow shielded wry indifference the usually talented helen hunt the worst offender one atrocious touched angel moment hunt slaps osmet immediately covering her mouth with the guilty hand that very same stroke and with said hand still said mouth she actually begins convulsing dry heaving really then and not making this she scurries the kitchen tearing the place apart frenzied search for alcohol the scene hokey could very nearly construed parody hackneyed movie blow ups all very theatrical especially hunt performance which feels like pathetic plea the academy for another oscar pay forward has the dubious distinction being film that could used argument for why actors shouldn get academy awards the picture unknowingly affirms that oscars transform nuanced talent into overwrought expressionists even haley joel osemt the wunderkind who was nominated for academy award for his unforced performance sixth sense seems more divisive about his expressions and inflections his acting has become broader less intimate can make out the little munchkin thoughts boy this outta floor naturally osmet made play one those only the movies children martyr figure who cleans after his mother lectures her the ills drinking and even fixes her date with his intellectual teacher never mind that the two couldn more dissimilar his mother trailer trash dopey and the teacher one those dennis miller intellectuals who hides his insecurities behind vast vocabulary nevertheless this little nudnik goes out his way bring the pair together scene that recalls parent trap ish cornball antics but how love bright articulate self sacrificing children who pick adults their bootstraps and guide them through life they adorable course the blame can all hoisted onto the actors though with the exception the little kid they probably should have known better instead the brunt should passed mimi leder who directed one the most thrilling episodes then went make two awful genre films row the first being the peacemaker witless post cold war george clooney vehicle and deep impact one the two films 1998 squander the premise earth possible demise crazed meteorite the first flick was sunk over reliance clich and complete absence any kind emotional involvement not aided ending which actually centered around the diffusing ticking time bomb complete with digital read out apparently present for invisible audience deep impact has more common with pay forward movie that treats earth impending destruction awfully simplistic terms completely ignoring the havoc that would obviously take place the world believed its planet would goner within days the film was full inspirational speeches where people really said nothing though the sappy score swelled make appear they were being profoundly touching pay forward leder continues this vein with her intermittent dollops cynicism seeming almost like rebuttal see movie isn you might think she seems saying just horribly confused
